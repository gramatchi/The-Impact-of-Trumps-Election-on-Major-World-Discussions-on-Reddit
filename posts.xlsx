> Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election. Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!

> Let me explain: if even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, something that the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible, that would be about 2 million new legal voters in 4 years. 

> The voting margin in the swing states is often less than 20 thousand votes. That means if the ‚ÄúDemocratic‚Äù Party succeeds, there will be no more swing states!!

> ""I was living in California and everyone around me was a Democrat and I really just wanted to build technology: cars, rockets, space, internet, and do useful things. I didn't want to be involved in politics, I don't want to be the President, I want to build products and services people love. 

> But I came to a conclusion that we are at a fork in the road of the destiny of America, of the Western world and perhaps of Civilization as a whole, because I saw erosion of freedom of speech, the right to bear arms and the constitution generally, and the oppressive nature of the Federal government getting worse every year. And then there's this whole open borders thing which is just total madness. 

> I was hearing one story after another of friends of mine that were being violently assaulted and robbed. And it's been getting way worse every year. My mom used to walk around New York a few years ago without fear, and now three of her friends have been assaulted and nobody even got arrested. Now she only walks her dog inside of her apartment building. I hear these stories from many, many people. There's hardly a downtown in America that's safe to walk in.

ElonMusk,elonmusk,"The first full quote ([linked here](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1837908705683059166)) is below and was pinned by Elon:

--------------------

> SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starships to Mars in two years. 

> If those all land safely, then crewed missions are possible in four years. If we encounter challenges, then the crewed missions will be postponed another two years.

> It is only possible to travel from Earth to Mars every two years, when the planets are aligned. This increases the difficulty of the task, but also serves to immunize Mars from many catastrophic events on Earth. 

> No matter what happens with landing success, SpaceX will increase the number of spaceships traveling to Mars exponentially with every transit opportunity. We want to enable anyone who wants to be a space traveler to go to Mars! That means you or your family or friends ‚Äì anyone who dreams of great adventure. 

> Eventually, there will be thousands of Starships going to Mars and it will a glorious sight to see! Can you imagine? Wow. 

> The fundamental existential question is whether humanity becomes sustainably multiplanetary before something happens on Earth to prevent that, for example nuclear war, a supervirus or population collapse that weakens civilization to the point where it loses the ability to send supply ships to Mars. 

> One of my biggest concerns right now is that the Starship program is being smothered by a mountain of government bureaucracy that grows every year. This stifling red tape is affecting all large projects in America, which is why, for example, California has spent ~$7 billion dollars and several years on high-speed rail, but only has a 1600 ft section of concrete to show for it!

> While I have many concerns about a potential Kamala regime, my absolute showstopper is that the bureaucracy currently choking America to death is guaranteed to grow under a Democratic Party administration. This would destroy the Mars program and doom humanity. 

> It cannot happen. Your help would be much appreciated. This is a fork, maybe the fork, in the road of human destiny.

--------------------------

Afterwards, Elon [also posted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1837913942859067438) regarding the main source of funds to allow Starship to exist and develop:

-------------

> By the way, our commercial Starlink program is the primary source of funding for Starship (NASA is helping too). 

> So thank for buying Starlink and supporting humanity‚Äôs future in space. 

> If you look closely at your Starlink router, you will notice that it has an illustration of the Earth-Mars transfer orbit.",t2_artk,Elon speaks about the timeline for Starship launches (uncrewed and crewed) along with increasing government bureaucracy each year that may hinder or even destroy the Mars program,0.64,53,1727044544.0,1727044544.0,93,twinbee,1fn5mt4

Biden,BidenIsNotMyPresident,"Hey Fact Checkers, I need y‚Äôall to earn your money and do your job. I ain‚Äôt got time to check this, y‚Äôall need to. And everybody else needs to pay attention. But it is ALL TRUE!

Things you must know to be an informed voter in 2024:

* THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN USED TO WORK FOR GEORGE SOROS.*

* CALIF GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM IS NANCY PELOSI'S NEPHEW

* ADAM SHIFF'S SISTER IS MARRIED TO ONE OF GEORGE SOROS‚Äô SONS.

* JOHN KERRY'S DAUGHTER IS MARRIED TO A MULLAH'S SON IN IRAN.

* HILLARY'S DAUGHTER CHELSEA IS MARRIED TO GEORGE SOROS' NEPHEW.

* ABC NEWS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER IAN CAMERON IS MARRIED TO SUSAN RICE, OBAMA'S FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER.

* CBS PRESIDENT DAVID RHODES IS THE BROTHER OF BEN RHODES, OBAMA'S DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS.

* ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT CLAIRE SHIPMAN IS MARRIED TO JAY CARNEY, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY.

* ABC NEWS AND UNIVISION REPORTER MATTHEW JAFFE IS MARRIED TO KATIE HOGAN, OBAMA'S FORMER DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY

* ABC PRESIDENT BEN SHERWOOD IS THE BROTHER OF ELIZABETH SHERWOOD, OBAMA'S FORMER SPECIAL ADVISER.

* CNN VP VIRGINIA MOSELEY IS MARRIED TO TOM NIDES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON'S DEPUTY SECRETARY.

THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A ""STACKED DECK"". IF YOU HAD A HUNCH THE NEWS MEDIA WAS SOMEWHAT RIGGED AND YOU COULDN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT, THIS MIGHT HELP YOU SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

Now you know why no one is investigated. They all have their hands in the cookie jar! You might remember James Comey who investigated the Clinton email scandal and the Clinton Foundation, and made the final decision to not recommend prosecution by the DOJ.

It turns out that the Clinton Foundation was audited by the law firm DLA Piper. One of the executives there was in charge of the Clinton Foundation audit.

Who was it? Peter Comey, James Comey‚Äôs brother. Peter Comey held an executive position with the Washington law firm that did the audit of the Clinton foundation in 2015.   Peter Comey was officially DLA Piper ‚ÄúSenior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas,‚Äù in 2015 when the Clinton Foundation scandals first broke and Hillary was preparing her Presidential campaign.  Not only was DLA Piper, the firm where Comey‚Äôs brother worked involved in the audit of the Clinton Foundation, but according to the foundation‚Äôs donor records, DLA Piper has given between $50 - 100k to the Foundation  It gets even cozier. DLA Piper executive Douglas Emhoff is taking an extended leave of absence from the firm. Who is Douglas Emhoff?   He is the husband of KAMALA HARRIS! Just a strange coincidence?   Amazing if it is. You can't make this stuff up! Another example of the DC swamp.‚Äù

And it only gets worse.  This ""Family Tree"" will make your head spin . . THE SWAMP IS DEEP!!

Dominion (voting machine provider) serves 40% of the US market. It is in 30 states - - The state of Texas rejected the machines.

- Admiral Peter Neffenger is on Biden's transition team.

- Neffenger was the President of the board of Smartmatic

- Smartmatic (another voting machine supplier) entered into an agreement with Dominion in 2009

- Smartmatic counted votes in Venezuela

- Smartmatic is connected to Philippine voter fraud

- Smartmatic is run by Lord Mark Malloch Brown who works for George Soros (-he and Brown are life-long friends)

- Brown chairs the Boards of a number of non-profit boards including the Open Society Foundation,

- Brown chairs the Centre for Global Development.

- Open society of course is owned by George Soros

- Smartmatic partnered with DLA Piper Global

- Douglas C. Emhoff works at DLA Piper Global

- Douglass C. Emhoff is Kamala Harris's husband

- Guess who owns Dominion? - -Blum Capital Partners, L.P.

- Guess who is on the board for the company? -- Richard Blum.

- Richard C. Blum is Dianne Feinstein's husband.

- Nancy Pelosi's husband is also a major investor

- An aide to Nancy Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, was hired by Dominion Voting Systems

And it goes on & ON!!

- Dominion Voting Systems is listed on the Clinton Foundation website.

- Dominion Voting is listed as a $25,000 -$50,000 donor to the Clinton Foundation in 2014 by The Washington Post

- Georgia Governor Kemp used Dominion Voting after Texas and Florida rejected them

- Dominion has a lobbyist named Jared Thomas

- Jared Thomas was Governor Brian Kemp‚Äôs chief of staff and press secretary from 2012 to 2015

- You must remember the Feinstein-Kavanaugh-Soros connections to understand this next information

- Debra Katz (Christine Ford's lawyer) worked for George-Soros at the Open Society Foundation.

- Debra Katz (Christine Ford's lawyer) also worked at Project on Government Oversight (POGO).

- POGO is funded by Soros‚Äôs Open Society Foundation.

- POGO is the co-signer of the letter Diane Feinstein presented against Kavanaugh's nomination.

- Kamala Harris did not prosecute OneWest Bank for their fraud when she had the authority - Soros owned OneWest Bank.

- Now you know why a woman who placed 7th in her own State when running for President is now VP and the Dem‚Äôs nominee for President after overthrowing ‚Äòol Joe Biden.

But now, he has coalesced a multi cultural group of people who cross party lines so they can help Trump save America. 

The party has changed, we have two if not all three branches of government. With the current attitudes we could hopefully change the GOVERNMENT for the better. Constitutionally and Democratically of course. 

This would of never happened in 2020 the way it can now.

Biden,BidenIsNotMyPresident,"I'm no swami but there is a very high probability that he will. 

He has portrayed himself as an inept fool in the eyes of the world üåé.  His lies and crazy ü§™ stories would be laughable but his far-left policies  make our country a more dangerous place.

Just a few points to consider:

President Joe Biden spent three days this week campaigning in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania. He littered his remarks with false and misleading claims on subjects ranging from his annual earnings to his cap on seniors‚Äô prescription drug spending to the demographics of China to the frequency of his past travel to Iraq and Afghanistan.

And in Biden‚Äôs most eyebrow-raising remarks of the campaign swing, he told and then retold a story in which he strongly suggested his late uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down while he fought in World War II. Biden‚Äôs dramatic details don‚Äôt match the Defense Department‚Äôs official account of the plane crash.

CNN Fact check: https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/fact-check-biden-pennsylvania-campaign-swing/index.html

Joe Biden's average job approval rating during his third year in office was the lowest of any president since Jimmy Carter. This is unsurprising given the numerous crises Americans face because of Biden's failed Far Left policies. 

According to Gallup: 
 
""During President Joe Biden's third full year in office, spanning Jan. 20, 2023, to Jan. 19, 2024, an average of 39.8% of Americans approved of his job performance. Among prior presidents in the Gallup polling era who were elected to their first term, only Jimmy Carter fared worse in his third year.""

According to the new Harvard poll Trump is gaining ground with young people aged 18-29. Also major gains with black males.

Biden,BidenIsNotMyPresident,"Dr. David Weinstein decided to move his practice from the city to the country because he liked the slower pace of life and the down to earth nature of the locals. He particularly liked the unique perspective of some of the local farmers. One day, Dr. Weinstein dropped in on old farmer Higgins. They got to talking about politics.

Farmer Higgins said, ""Well, ya know, that candidate is a 'Post Turtle'.""

Not being familiar with the term, Dr. Weinstein asked him what a 'post turtle' was.

Farmer Higgins said, ""When you're driving down a country road you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle'.""

Farmer Higgins saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain.

Why should I have to act this angry and outraged when my anxiety was through the roof during the summer, and I'm finally feeling calmer?  It's really fucked up logic. Excuse me if part of me happens to be satisfied with the result. I, like a lot of people, got holidays and amazing events ripped away from me in 2020 and 2021 and they got dangled in my face as if I'd possibly get another chance but nooooo. And to me, Trump winning is the well deserved spanking on their asses for pushing all the Covid bs and not letting people say what they want. 

Anyone else feel the same? 

For the millionth time, I get that Big T is far from a perfect man and says a lot of questionable shit.

Zuckerberg has seen cases get to the supreme court and he is scared. He is also smart. He sees how the tide is going out and is switching sides. He knows protecting those who are losing will make him a loser. He does not love Democrats enough to go down with the ship. 

The pendulum is starting to swing the other way. Democrats are losing in court on a number of issues. People are standing up to big government and refusing to back down. 

They have lost a lot of respect and power since 2020. Most of all, long time Democrats in big business are leaving blue states. Two Democrat presidential candidates are endorsing Trump. Well.... Kennedy ran as an independent, but it still counts as a defection.

Biden,BidenIsNotMyPresident,"Everything was better before Biden

The sky was blue but now it's grey

Everything was better before Biden

That's what I hear the people say


Everything was better before Biden

You could afford a decent life

Now we compete with migrants

For a house, job, food and wife


Everything was better before Biden

All the races got along

Then they burned and looted America

And our unity's all gone


Everything was better before Biden

The American Dream has died

A puppet run by foreigners

Has cheated, failed and lied


Everything was better before Biden

Before a woman was a man

And all this utter nonsense

Not even Commies understand


Everything was better before Biden

When a dollar had some worth

We haven't had less to believe in

Since this great nation's birth


Everything was better before Biden

Dems shut the country down

Over a flu strain that killed no one 

In our entire town


Now the real deaths are coming

World War Three is here

Corporations have been killing it, so they're all in good cheer

That's why they're pushing this guy, he represents them all

Trump,trump,"Reddit has shown an undeniable bias against Trump, to the point of shutting down his once-popular forum, a space where millions of his supporters gathered to share their views and express their opinions. This blatant censorship reflects a troubling pattern of silencing voices that don‚Äôt align with the platform‚Äôs ideological leanings. It‚Äôs hard not to feel frustrated by such actions, especially when a platform that markets itself as a hub for open discussion and free speech takes deliberate steps to suppress one side of the conversation.

I hope Trump takes decisive action to address this imbalance, holding platforms like Reddit accountable for their partisan behavior. Their disregard for fair treatment, combined with their inflated valuation, makes it hard to sympathize if their stock were to plummet as a result.

 Am I seeing wrong? It can't be!


As much as the bought media says otherwise...

At this point,the incredible support for trump is becoming visible,both from what iv seen myself and online

It's literally shocking,I personally know alot of dems who have already voted early for trump

There has also been an uptick in support for him in hardcore dem zones like cali ( again ,the media won't show or talk about this)

Additionally...the desperation on the dem side is also becoming visible,

Examples:

-Bill gates at this late stage throwing 50 mil in the harris campaign

-obama coming out regularly to campaign

-Harris failing every interview she gets by talking crap even when the reporters are on her side...

-major fake news outlets have increasingly started to criticise her

-her lack of successful events

-majority loss of the Latino vote

-majority loss of the arab/muslim vote (an entire muslim majority dem town pledged support to trump and practically any Muslim I ask,says they voting for trump)

-loss of the black vote in many major cities 



With how stuff is looking,I can easily see a 400 electoral vote win? (the reagan one maybe abit too far fetched but hey,you never knowüôÇ)

What's your thoughts on this and what you estimating?

Is it just me or am I seeing a ridiculous amount of people on all sides voting for trump?...and I'm not talking about just what I see online,I'm talking about people I know,meet and what I'm seeing daily

Trump,trump,"I don‚Äôt know whether to continue to laugh for the rest of my life considering almost no one will ever get to say ‚Äúyeah. I flicked off the first ever female presidential candidate in the US‚Ä¶but she‚Äôs honestly kinda evil so whatever‚Äù and feel justified because of the destruction she causes, or feel like shit because that action stoops just as low as the democrats. 

I don‚Äôt know whether to feel embarrassed or very accomplished. It‚Äôs something that so many people want to do, but in the moment wouldn‚Äôt. I almost put my hand down. In a small moment of anger towards her and her policies I impulsively just kept my middle finger up‚Ä¶

I live near LAX and she was headed to the airport to board Airforce 2. As we reached the very end of Pershing drive going southbound and were stopped at the very end light, Kamala‚Äôs entire motorcade turned the corner and began a to drive past us northbound. Our lane, far left lane, was the closest one to them. Her car drove right past us. The windows were not really super tinted. We saw her, and as she turned the corner she could see everyone in their cars. Everyone could see each other. It‚Äôs not hard to. We could all see her in the backseat.m

For about 2-3 brief seconds, as her car got closer and approached its parallel point to us, she looked at me, and then put her head down. To keep the quality of the footage my middle finger is not in the video, but it was there behind the camera. The camera doesn‚Äôt do justice to what my husband and I actually saw in that car. 

Either way 2 hours later we just went home and I jammed to music so casually as if I did not just hand signal fuck you to the vice president of the United States and the first ever female VP. Lawwwdddd.

Trump,trump,"To everyone who voted for Trump, thank you. Thank you for not being blinded by lies by mainstream media, for not believing every headline, and for being a critical thinker. This election was the most important our lifetime, choosing unity of everybody, rather than unity of the few. The Democrats ran a campaign of division, as they often do. In the eyes of democrats, we are White, Black, Hispanic, Trans and Gay, but in the eyes of Trump we are all just Americans. America was divided by leftism and the democrats, making us forget our identity as American in exchange for LGBT or ethnic identities. I am an Arab American, yet by every democrat and leftist, I was just a straight Arab male who happened to live in America. In Trump's America, im just an American, and so are all of you. They tried and failed to erase our unity, erase our American culture. They try to divide women from men, old from young, white from black, hispanic from asian, gay from straight. Democrats are obsessed with labels, dividing us up like we are all different and can't coexist. They are trying to divide the majority. Poisoning our children, our classrooms, our governments, with divisive labels to break our American unity. We can coexist, and we are all united as Americans. No matter your color, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, we are all Americans who live by the Constitution and need to continue to protect it and our nation at all costs.

I am a Mexican-American, I have supported Trump since I was 14 and voted for him this election. my parents are legal immigrants and worked their asses off to give my family a comfortable lifestyle. I grew up privileged in an upper class neighborhood, always had everything I needed, I‚Äôm at a nice out of state university, paid for by my parents and have more opportunities than the majority of people. Growing up I‚Äôve mostly been around white people, I‚Äôve had many friends that are both conservative and liberal. When a conservative is ‚Äúracist‚Äù it a little joke about how I‚Äôm a landscaper or that they‚Äôre going to call ICE or whatever. Conservatives have always been more welcoming and never fixate on my race. Conservatives don‚Äôt treat me differently or patronize me and I really appreciate that because I‚Äôm more than my race. I‚Äôve never experienced racism quite like that from liberals, they assume that because I‚Äôm a minority that my life must have been difficult and how they ‚Äúsee my struggles‚Äù like NO my life has been on easy mode. It‚Äôs disrespectful to all the hard work my parents put in to get here and be successful. Liberals assume that I care about immigration because I‚Äôm hispanic when in reality I‚Äôm in favor of mass deportation. They also think that I must be struggling to pay for college BECAUSE I‚ÄôM A MINORITY. Many of my liberal friends became the nastiest people when I told them that I support Trump and voted for him, just a complete 180 telling me how they ‚Äúhope my family gets deported‚Äù.

All these subreddits that have NOTHING to do with politics are now banning links from X bc of Elon üôÑ 

All these rants about how terrified they are to live here now that Trump is president are just ridiculous. We dealt with the worst president in history for the last 4 years they will survive. The things I see posted are just utter nonsense. People saying they are worried bc they are an immigrant or married to one. Illegals and immigrants are not the same thing people ! And those people saying Baron isn‚Äôt a US citizen  bc Melania wasn‚Äôt a US citizen yet lol. She was here on a valid green card which meet the requirements Trump is proposing. Why are these people so fucking stupid. 

I know things will calm down over the next few months but man it‚Äôs insane. Also sucks when I see friends on mine on fb post such ridiculous things and I have to just keep my mouth shut. Why is it that they are always allowed to say whatever they want with no repercussions but conservatives are always getting censored and called every name in the book.

I have a lot of reasons, but one of the biggest ones is the horrible way I have been treated when I express support for Trump. I had no idea that people would come after someone even for just acknowledging that Trump does some things right. I literally have voted Democrat before and have supported Democratic candidates, but that's not good enough. Just because I don't like a single democratic presidential candidate and don't want to vote for her, people on the left think I'm human garbage now. It's really confusing why they do this. You would think these ""accepting and tolerant"" people would try to explain how their candidate is better and that you should come over to their side. But it's like the second you disagree with them about 1 thing they start calling you far right and turning on you.

Trump,trump,"I live in McAllen, Texas, right on the border with Mexico. Every day, I witness busloads of people being taken to the Catholic Charities building, where they are hidden from public view to avoid drawing attention. These charities take funds from the state of Texas and the community to harbor illegal immigrants.

For eight years, I was an active member of the Democratic Party here, hoping for change. But after all that time, nothing improved. The only progress was for a select few at the top, who grew wealthier on the backs of workers and everyday Americans like my mother.

My father, who started a small business in 1987, is now forced to sell everything and retire because of President Biden‚Äôs policies. Operating costs have skyrocketed, while foreign companies across the border receive subsidies and leeway, putting countless Americans out of business.

I‚Äôm 28 years old and have voted Democrat my entire life‚Ä¶until now. I refuse to live this farce any longer. I proudly voted for Donald Trump and am switching to the Republican Party for good. As an American, I believe America should always come first.

POPULAR VOTE:
üîµ Harris: 48.5% (+0.9)
üî¥ Trump: 47.6%

ELECTORAL COLLEGE ODDS:
üî¥ Trump: 85%
üîµ Harris: 14.6%

BREAKDOWN: This is due to the ""Electoral College bias"" (highlighted below). Models are focusing on battleground state polls individually, and do not solely calculate the odds based on national polls.

Silver's own model says that because of the Electoral College, Harris MUST WIN the popular vote by 2-3 points to make this a truly ""tossup"" race. Anything under 2-3 = Trump is the favorite.

Right now, the national and state polls are severely out-of-step with each other. If the popular vote ends up as Silver's polling average, it would take a monumental realignment for Trump to lose.",t2_a0s2xy75,üö® BREAKING: Nate Silver's election model and national polling average suggests Trump has an 85% chance of winning the election on Tuesday.,0.87,409,1730648640.0,1730648640.0,96,MrPenny411,1gipr93

Trump,trump,"Last night I was at a Panera Bread in Lancaster, PA, a marginally red county that has seen an influx of NY and NJ people moving in and taking their politics with them. 
Two of the three kiosks were broken and the line at the counter was long. A couple and their children were standing at the electronic kiosk flipping though the menu over and over again like their life depends on which sandwich they are going to order from Panera. They were completely oblivious to the line of people forming behind them. One lady literally left the store.
After about 10 minutes of this nonsense I started to think about how entitled these people were and how they must be Democrats. My blood was boiling but I don‚Äôt like confrontation so I bit my lip. Finally they finish, but one of their kids parks her ass in front of the kiosk. I simply reach over the kid and start typing my order.
‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt wait until we finished,‚Äù the mother said. ‚ÄúYou have got to be kidding me,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou people think you are the only people in the world,‚Äù I continued. After she became irate and said something else to me I simply replied and said, I can tell you are a couple of Harris Voters.‚Äù With a red angry lib face she replied, ‚ÄúDamn straight we are you Trumper!‚Äù

Harris voters can be identified easily because they are assholes. They are the people in the left lane doing 47MPH who won‚Äôt move over. They block the grocery store aisle with their cart. Yes, they‚Äôll even treat a chain restaurant as if they own the place. 

It is not just about voting FOR Trump. It is about beating these people and sending them into a mental health crisis. They all deserve it.

Trump,trump,"Democrats keep saying the Tariffs will make everything more expensive. That's totally false.

When everything you buy at the store is made in a foreign country, you know there's something wrong. By putting tariffs on foreign countries(especially Enemies) it will force the big companies to move their production and factories to the USA and make it with American materials.

Republicans,republicans,"I have never used Reddit habitually, but I unusually decided to compare the members of Dems and Repubs on Reddit. 

19,444 Republicans

480,222 Democrats

Ratio of 1 : 25 

There are 4% of Republicans compared to the Democrat subreddit members. This appears‚Äîpossibly, as blatant partiality or the natural gravitation of this platform‚Äôs user ideologies.

I advocate to unite this nation beyond the tribalistic two-party system, but I had to witness the meltdown of the Left after Trump‚Äôs 2024 election. This is a significant opportunity to elucidate those who have fallen to indoctrination within these following years.

This platform is clearly a mouthpiece of the autocratic governance of the Democratic party. Censorship, propoganda, ommitance, and filtering. It‚Äôs flagrantly evident in its bot monitoring, censorship, and selected bias of alleigance to the democrats.

Republicans,republicans,"
In recent years, the Republican Party has become increasingly fixated on the so-called ‚Äúculture wars.‚Äù From pushing legislation that targets LGBTQ+ rights to imposing restrictions on reproductive health, the GOP seems determined to legislate morality based on a narrow interpretation of Christian values. But this approach isn‚Äôt just alienating voters; it‚Äôs also a losing strategy that distracts from the more pressing issues facing our nation. If Republicans want to win back the trust of the American people and truly make a difference, they need to stop evangelizing through legislation and refocus on critical issues like the economy, jobs, immigration, and the national debt.

The Republican Party's obsession with the culture wars is not just misguided; it‚Äôs also deeply counterproductive. By focusing on issues like banning books in schools, restricting gender-affirming care, and policing what is considered ""appropriate"" in the public sphere, Republicans are essentially micromanaging morality. This approach is not only out of touch with a growingly diverse and secular society, but it also undermines the very principles of freedom and limited government that the party claims to uphold.

Legislating morality through a political party is a dangerous game. It risks turning the GOP into a tool for religious imposition rather than a vehicle for conservative governance. This strategy not only alienates moderates and independents, who may share some conservative values but reject the heavy-handedness of morality-based legislation, but it also alienates younger voters, who increasingly see the GOP as out of step with modern America. As a result, Republicans are losing the culture wars and, with it, the broader political battle.

While the GOP is busy fighting over bathroom bills and book bans, real issues are being neglected. The American people are concerned about the economy, inflation, jobs, immigration, foreign policy, and the national debt‚Äîissues that affect their daily lives and the future of the country. Yet, these topics often take a back seat to the latest culture war skirmish.

The economy is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation remains a concern for many households, and job growth is a critical issue. Moreover, immigration policy needs a comprehensive overhaul, and foreign policy challenges, particularly in relation to China and Russia, require serious attention. The national debt continues to balloon, posing long-term risks to economic stability. These are the issues that Republicans should be addressing if they want to be seen as a party that can govern effectively.

Focusing on these core issues would not only resonate with a broader swath of voters but also demonstrate that the GOP is serious about leadership. Economic growth, job creation, and national security are areas where conservative policies can make a significant impact‚Äîareas where Republicans can lead rather than divide.

For many Christians, the culture wars are about defending values they hold dear. But if the goal is to influence culture, relying on legislation is not the answer. Change doesn‚Äôt happen from the top down; it happens from the grassroots up. Christians who want to make a difference should focus on being active within their communities and churches, rather than depending on the Republican Party to legislate morality.

History offers a powerful example of this. In the early days of Christianity, the Roman Empire was a place where infanticide was tragically common. Unwanted babies were often left to die in the streets. The early Christians didn't respond by petitioning the Roman authorities or demanding new laws. Instead, they took action. They rescued these babies, cared for them, and raised them as their own. They started orphanages and established a tradition of adoption, embodying their values through compassionate action rather than relying on the state to enforce their beliefs.

This is a model of how Christians can influence culture‚Äînot by demanding that the government impose their values, but by actively living out those values in a way that transforms society from within. Just as the early church took in abandoned children, modern Christians can address today‚Äôs cultural challenges through direct action, service, and outreach.

Republicans need to recognize that the culture wars are a distraction from the real issues facing our nation. If they continue down this path, they will not only lose the culture wars but also their credibility as a party capable of governing. It‚Äôs time for the GOP to refocus on the economy, jobs, national security, and other critical issues that truly matter to the American people.

For Christians, the answer isn‚Äôt to double down on legislating morality. Instead, it‚Äôs to lead by example and influence culture through action, not through laws. The culture wars aren‚Äôt won in the halls of Congress‚Äîthey‚Äôre won in the hearts and minds of the people. It‚Äôs time for Republicans to remember that and to chart a new course, one that prioritizes governance over grievance, and leadership over legislation.

Remember that the Declaration of Independence states:

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""

Which expresses the fundamental principles of individual rights and liberty. And while many of the founders were indeed Christian they still left room for a freedom of religion beyond the scope of Christianity and only really acknowledges intelligent design.

Republicans,republicans,"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced on May 31 that he has left the Democratic Party and become an independent.

‚ÄúMy commitment to do everything I can to bring our country together has led me to register as an independent with no party affiliation,‚Äù Mr. Manchin wrote in a post on the social media platform X, showing a picture of himself with what appeared to be a voter registration form.

‚ÄúI have seen both the Democrat and Republican parties leave West Virginia and our country behind for partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy. Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground.‚Äù

Mr. Manchin‚Äôs departure from the party does not change Democrat control of the Senate.

He joins Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom caucus with the Democrats.

Mr. Manchin, who has been in the Senate since November 2010, has been critical of President Joe Biden, particularly regarding his green energy policies, despite voting for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which included aggressive climate change-related measures.

He was key in preventing the Democrats from abolishing the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for most legislation to proceed to a final vote in the Senate.

Mr. Manchin, 76, explored a possible third-party run. However, he said it would be ‚Äúvery challenging‚Äù and a ‚Äúdeal-breaker‚Äù or ‚Äúspoiler.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe system right now is not set up for [it]. [In] the long game, maybe we can make a third party viable where it has a process and opportunity. Right now, it‚Äôs very challenging,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not going to be a deal breaker, if you will, spoiler, whatever you want to call it,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right time.‚Äù

He has declined to endorse President Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not endorsing anybody right now. We‚Äôre going to see what all happens,‚Äù Mr. Manchin told CNN on Feb. 19.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had this conversation with him and with his people that he‚Äôs gone too far to the left. They‚Äôve pushed him and pulled him, and whatever. But that‚Äôs not where America is. That‚Äôs not where our country is,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping the Joe Biden that we saw in 2020 will be the Joe Biden we see in 2024 if that can be done. If not, it‚Äôs going to be a long road for everybody,‚Äù he added.

Mr. Manchin declined to run for reelection this year and his seat is expected to flip to the GOP with the election of Gov. Jim Justice.

‚ÄúAfter months of deliberation and long conversation with my family, I believe in my heart of hearts that I have accomplished what I have set out to do for West Virginia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I will not be running for reelection to the United States Senate.‚Äù

Earlier this year, Mr. Manchin passed on a presidential run.

‚ÄúI will not be seeking a third-party run,‚Äù he said in West Virginia. ‚ÄúI will not be involved in a presidential run.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúI will be involved in making sure that we secure a president that has the knowledge and has the passion and has the ability to bring this country together.‚Äù

Republicans,republicans,"

One of the most, if not the most important and well known founders of our great nation as well as its first president, George Washington, warned in his Farewell Address in 1796 against the dangers of political parties. He believed they could lead to divisions within the country and distract the government from its primary duties. 

Specifically, he said:

‚ÄúThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension...is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual.‚Äù

George Washington emphasized that political parties could (will), foster factionalism, create divisions, and ultimately threaten the stability and unity of the nation.

The proof of his personal ideas and beliefs in his speech is evident in the modern political zeitgeist of the United States of America.",t2_2u2yyk67,Always Remeber,0.77,5,1721896095.0,1721896095.0,1,DrxHyOnPotENuse,1ebpqnq

This is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn‚Äôt even showered yet because our work isn‚Äôt quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn‚Äôt complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion. My husband the veteran doesn‚Äôt want Traitor Trump to ever get near the White House again and he is so tired of the GOP and their negativity, fascist tendencies, and deeply skewed version of ‚Äúpatriotism.‚Äù My man is a hard working patriot and is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

And then just watching her campaign, talk, and actually talk like most of us think while still giving political policies and actually not taking the high road in talking about Republicans like they've done to us for so many years

Then picking waltz who is just, maybe, the best pick we could've gotten for a vp...likeable, and hardly a shroud of negativity except maybe exiting the military after giving proper notice and before his time to leave for Iraq..the nerve

Democrats,democrats,"For the first time in my life, I was drawn out to vote. 

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

i **understand** the constant gaslighting is exhausting. 

i **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  

i **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   

i **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.

i **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're ""overreacting"".

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

i **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  

i **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  

i **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present

i **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just ""being too sensitive"" and reduces everything he does into a ""joke"" that you ""misunderstood"" 

i **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   

i **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. 

i **understand** because i *survived* it.  

But America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. 

I know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     

America, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.

Democrats,democrats,"I have been seeing this very misguided idea floating around this sub, so I‚Äôve decided to put it to rest by calculating the remaining vote and seeing how we can expect it to add up. I‚Äôm only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I‚Äôm not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I‚Äôll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California ‚Äî 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris‚Äôs favor):

Harris ‚Äî 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon ‚Äî 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 257,107 votes
Trump ‚Äî 197,631 votes

Washington ‚Äî 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 297,296 votes
Trump ‚Äî 198,028 votes

Maryland ‚Äî 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 333,894 votes
Trump ‚Äî 201,877 votes

Arizona ‚Äî 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 384,839 votes
Trump ‚Äî 433,563 votes

Nevada ‚Äî 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 63,416 votes
Trump ‚Äî 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I‚Äôll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris ‚Äî 75,054,105 
Trump ‚Äî 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because ‚Äú20 million Democrats just couldn‚Äôt get off the couch.‚Äù Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we‚Äôve been seeing globally due to inflation.

In the past few weeks I‚Äôve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn‚Äôt want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don‚Äôt like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let‚Äôs be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

Half of the calls were hang ups but I did reach about 18 actual people who talked for a bit. 10 out of these said they were definitely either voting for Kamala or already have. 1 caller, my favorite one, actually left the call ‚Äúundecided‚Äù but leaning more toward Harris. He‚Äôs a guy in his mid-20s from Mississippi originally and works in Atlanta now. We talked for about 30 min while he was driving and I had a genuine connection with him while he was explaining what was most important to him. The economy was a big point, he didn‚Äôt like how the top 1% has benefitted from so many policies (Trump‚Äôs tax cuts absolutely fueled this). He was also disappointed with the Jan 6 attempted coup and abortion bans in the south. He doesn‚Äôt necessarily buy into the ‚Äúdoom and gloom‚Äù messaging on the left, which I didn‚Äôt want to push because I wanted to keep the convo going, and we left with him leaning less towards trjmp and more undecided but very interested in reading more about each platform. We talked for awhile about my family and situation and what I felt would benefit the middle class by the Harris/Walz plan. Ultimately he‚Äôll make his own decision but I felt so refreshed from this call because he‚Äôs in the demographic we all see as ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù trumpies: young white men. I told him to tell all his friends to vote and he was eager to do so. I felt like if this was a troll, our call would not have lasted so long (27 min!). If you can, please volunteer to phone bank. There are a lot of people who hang up or are rude and that‚Äôs fine. I got this one caller and 10 others who gave me SO much hope. Let‚Äôs win this and reach the hearts and minds of all the regular Americans who are tired of trump and the GOP!!!

Democrats,democrats,"At the rally, I was seated next to a 90 year old black woman. She was instrumental in the civil rights movement in Milwaukee, working along side James Groppi. She showed me so many pictures and shared stories with me about her life, and what she went through to fight for her freedoms. She was born in 1934, and has endured so much hardship and effort just to hope to be considered an equal.

The entire time the Kamala was on stage, this woman was squeezing my hand. My eyes were watering like a damn hose. It was incredible and so powerful sitting next to her. I can't put into words the emotions I felt while sharing that moment with her, squeezing my hand while she smiled and cried happy tears.

It was surreal, it was such a strong emotion that I've never felt before. I'll never forget that, or forget her. That moment will live in the forefront of my brain for the rest of my life. I'm getting teary-eyed right now just thinking about her. She said ""this right here young man, this right here is what l've sacrificed so much of my life for. This right here is the best moment of my life. Thank you for being here to experience it with me"".

This world can be a scary place for us all, and this experience reaffirmed my belief that our country is healing.
I don't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope some of you appreciate the fact that this woman is witnessing what she has fervently fought for. So many people in this country have fought tooth and nail for their freedom, and for this woman to be sitting next to me, a 30 year old white man, experiencing this with her was truly the best moment of MY life as well.

I tried posting this to other subs, with all political text changed to neutral words/names. Even made the effort to edit the photo to hide the jumbotron.

ü§óI voted for üíô Madam President Kamala Harris 
& Vice President Tim Walz üíô of course! Also YES on Issue 1, of course! I voted for all the democrats I could choose. Unfortunately, in Ohio, there were quite a few positions that had republican options only. üòî I hope that changes in Ohio üíô soon. 

The parking lot was practically full, and a bunch of people there to vote, but there wasn‚Äôt a wait. It was quite a long walk for the voting process considering I‚Äôm very ill. However, I wanted my vote to count and in a deep red area I wasn‚Äôt trusting this maga republican controlled area with my absentee ballot. 

A woman asked me if I‚Äôd like to sit down, I said yes please just for a moment. I didn‚Äôt realize she meant to vote. Which sounds lovely until you realize you have no privacy. I mean absolutely no privacy at all! I probably should have said umm no thanks üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è, but I was embarrassed enough (that‚Äôs a personal issue about my health, age & disability). If I had an issue I could quite easily raise my hand, reach out & touch any one of the multiple poll workers, or whisper for help they were so close. üòï The poll workers looking at how I‚Äôm voting, repeatedly. üëÄ Every person walking around the line for a voting station could easily read my screen/vote selection. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

But, even the standing vote area was lacking privacy. There was a partition, yet it didn‚Äôt really keep anything private. I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt do the booths with the curtains anymore?! Luckily I was able to snatch my printed vote selections before the poll worker did, and reassured them I‚Äôve got it from here thanks. 

üòä At least scanning my ballot went better this year.  This guy didn‚Äôt insist on taking it, reading it or putting it in the machine. He reassured me it can go in just about any way I wanted. Upside down and top end first. The machine didn‚Äôt show my selections. Only that my ballot was counted. Shew, yay!!! üòÑ 

A very nice cop at the entrance was welcoming and holding the door. As I left, I thanked him again, wished him a good day. He went on a bit, kindly. Then I said I hope they bring you lunch soon! Then he mentioned McDonald‚Äôs. I replied well it‚Äôs all American with a laugh. He said yeah I don‚Äôt eat any foreign foods! üòß He was dead serious. ü•¥ I replied I like a lot of foreign foods, but yeah everyone knows McDonald‚Äôs from birth. üò¨ ha ha üòï ü§î I‚Äôm thinking really, that‚Äôs how crazy this has gotten?! üòî

I‚Äôm glad I voted üó≥Ô∏è Hopefully they don‚Äôt pull any shenanigans with my vote. And I pray we pull through this election.

Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good‚ÄîGood afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, good afternoon. Thank you all.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So let me say (crowd screams love you), and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, **the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting**. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials I thank you. I thank you all. 

Look, I am so proud of the race we ran. And the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.

A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, **while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign**‚Äîthe fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.

I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.

And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways: in how we live our lives by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor, by always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But, like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. **And the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it**.  To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay. 

On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing, **sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power**. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.


You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. **This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves**. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look, many of you know I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives.  People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage a historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.

The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.

And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. Make God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. I thank you all.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"On August 1, 2022, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian cancer

I was told that is was incurable but treatable until it was no longer treatable 

The average life span for a woman with advanced Ovarian Cancer is 3 years.  
I will reach that date next August.  

I get chemotherapy every week but eventually I will run out of treatment options.

Cancer has changed me.  It has made me an optimist,  and more compassionate.

I never expected to survive long enough to see a woman, and a democrat of black and Asian descent reach the highest pinnacle in our land

Maybe a little extra special because my father immigrated to this country from India.  Married my mother, herself a child of immigrants from Norway 

We are the embodiment of the American dream, and it was my honor and privilege to cast my ballot for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Tim Walz seems like a great dad.  I should know about great dads.  Mine is still going strong at 88.  

My parents were happily married for over 60 years until my mother passed in 2021

I see in Kamala a women who is strong and fierce when she needs to be but that strength is tempered by kindness and strong family values (real family values not that fake pageantry you see put on for the benefit of the cameras)

Tomorrow, we make history and hopefully begin the long journey towards healing as a country.

And recognize that together we are strong, divided we will fall

I await the hour when we can honestly call her ‚ÄúPresident Elect Kamala Harris‚Äù

Now, what are you waiting for?  VOTE!!!

Edit:  Thank you so much for your kind words.  I wanted to share my story because I knew you would understand how special tomorrow will be to countless others.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Lessie Benningfield Randle, one of the two last living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, announced today that she has cast her ballot for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. Voting for Harris was a proud moment for Randle, who turns 110 on Nov. 10. Born in 1914, she was just a young girl when the prosperous Black community of Greenwood, also known as Black Wall Street, was razed to the ground in one of the most heinous episodes of racial violence in US history. 

Voting for Harris has taken on particular significance for Benningfield, considering that at the time of her birth, women didn‚Äôt have the right to vote. It wasn‚Äôt until President Lyndon B. Johnson passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that grandfather clauses, poll taxes, and the racial terror that kept Black people from the ballot box were outlawed, thanks to advocates such as Fannie Lou Hamer. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how much longer I have left. But if this is my last ballot, then I‚Äôm grateful that it‚Äôs for Kamala Harris,‚Äù said Ms. Benningfield, who cast an absentee ballot, said in a statement issued today. ‚ÄúI have five children and more than 20 grandbabies. VP Harris has the better chance of building the nation I want them to inherit.

‚ÄúMy grandchildren deserve a world where taking care of their parents isn‚Äôt a financial struggle, medication is affordable, and women are free. And all of our children deserve a president who will inspire them to learn from history, not a tyrant who will try to erase it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mob that murdered my neighbors in Greenwood was so angry, and this country is at risk of allowing that same anger to take over its soul again. But voters can say no to a politician that incites white folks to turn against their darker skin neighbors. Voters can say no to giving rogue police officers full immunity to terrorize us. We can say no to the candidates who are taking away students‚Äô freedom to learn about our country‚Äôs past. As voters, we must protect our children from politicians who believe that retribution and violence are virtues. Because I have lived through that nightmare. And trust me, we can‚Äôt afford to go back.‚Äù

Damario Solomon-Simmons, lead attorney for Ms. Randle and founder of Justice for Greenwood, is inspired by her courage. ‚ÄúAfter the City of Tulsa helped the white mob burn down 35 square blocks and kill hundreds of Black people, it didn't stop there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOfficials also conspired with some of the most powerful people in Oklahoma to keep the survivors silent for generations. Because Mother Randle summoned the strength to speak up, standing up to the forces against her, the world is learning more about the Tulsa Race Massacre.""

‚ÄúNobody who seeks to suppress our people's history yet again should occupy the Oval Office. That‚Äôs why she, and so many of us in Greenwood, are voting for Kamala Harris.‚Äù 

Along with Ms. Benningfield, there is one other living survivor of the Tulsa Race Massacre ‚Äì 110-year-old Viola Fletcher. She plans to vote for Ms. Harris in person on Election Day.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"For the last 21 years that I've been able to vote, I've voted straight ticket republican every election. I'll admit that I was a single issue voter, and my sole priority was protecting the second amendment (even today, it still is a very important issue to me, but I'll explain more later). 

I voted for Trump in 2016 and in 2020, but January 6 combined with Trumps felony business fraud conviction and his sexual assault case were my come to Jesus moments and  this time I'm not making that mistake. 

Trump is a liar, a traitor, a coward, and a criminal. He has no business holding public office ever again. I see the danger that he poses to our republic if he is given power and we need to come together as a country to put a stop to him once and for all (hopefully, though I wouldn't put a 2028 run past him if he's still alive.

This was not an easy decision. And I certainly  have my grievances with the Harris/Walz position on guns, but I recognize 2 key things that I think other Republicans that also don't want Trump back but are also hesitant to vote for Harris don't realize: 

1. Because our republic/democracy and the rule of law are respected under a Harris presidency, any new policies, be it guns or something else, can be challenged in court. If Trump wins, he'll just do whatever the hell he wants with no regard for acting within the law. 
I'd rather fight Harris in court over a policy I don't like than fight Trumps minions in the street over democracy as we know it.

2. What a politician wants to do, what they can do, what you can reasonably expect to happen in a term, what actually happens, and what actually happens that dosent get struck down or limited by the courts are very different things. 

While I know we probably disagree heavily on this, I hope we can work together in the coming months to focus on the immediate threat, Trump. He must never be given power ever again.

Edit: 

People, if you want to try and argue gun policy with me, DM me, and I'll happily get back to you at my earliest convenience, but that's not my intention for my post in this subreddit. I'm here in good faith because Trump sent policy disagreements to the bottom of my list of worries with this upcoming election.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Almost everyone who spoke at the event did an absolutely incredible job of conveying a far more positive and upbeat beat Democratic Party since Biden dropped out.

I was also very happy to see AOC and Peggy Flanagan speaking there alongside Raphael Warnock and several Civil Rights Activists. 

I was also incredibly happy to hear support for a ceasefire in Gaza from tons of the prominent speakers there. It was genuinely heartwarming to hear it getting such positive reception from within the DNC in general.

The constant hammering against Project 2025 was very good to see as well. I am to say the very least absolutely elated it is finally being taken seriously for the massive threat it is to our entire country. The bit with Mallory McMorrow from Michigan especially was absolute comedy gold with the massive Project 2025 book.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"So as the time gets closer and anxiety builds my mind wonders. I thought about Jan 6, and how it all happened. We all know that this probably went as far because the ring leader was on the inside allowing it. That won't happen this time. Biden/Harris are in charge and I know they are aware of it too. I'm sure a military presence will be there this time. 

My thought process is, are we really going to stand by and let this happen again? These fools will show up again. These fools will cause trouble. When do we gather in appropriate numbers and stop the violent take over that is going on? 

More people voted blue in 2017, and 2020. Blue needs to stand up for their rights! We need to be there for our leader and let these idiots know that WE HAVE a presence! WE HAVE a voice! And They do not get to bully themselves to the top. 

Take this picture of Jan 6, and insert +1 million Blue Democracy Savors in the front lines. Who knows how this would go down. We can't let them get the chance. Win or lose these losers will show up and I for one will too. We have to let the world know we don't stand for this shit! These idiots made us look like clowns to the world and are the reason this is still happening. 

If they want a peaceful tour of the capital in January this year, they need to get through every last one of us first!!! ‚úäÔ∏è We can't go back! We won't! Victory is the only option. Landslide! But if you're sick to death of domestic terrorism, this is your time to rise to the occasion. These cockroaches have no spine or heart. They back down at a moments notice when it gets real. They got caught up in 2021, but when a blue wall is there first, and there bigger and stronger, and there with true American spirit - that will be the end of this nightmare. 

I am not suggesting we bring violence at all. But in that picture, they showed up. We sat at home and watched. We watched them beat, break, smash, and kill their way in. I say if they were to start that march to the capital this time, knowing there was 1 million of us waiting for them. This Will Not Happen Again! 

Stay safe, rep your Harris gear proudly, fly your Harris flag next to your neighbors no matter what they think. We aren't scared! They scared us to stay home last time and we did. Change is here!

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I‚Äôm almost 40 and vowed to stay out of all politics through my entire life but after seeing it daily for 15 years in the military and growing up in backwoods Florida, I‚Äôm done ignoring it. I raised by religious republicans who ingrain every part of their lives with their political affiliation. I pass half a dozen MAGA stickers driving anywhere through town. The mean old man across the street has a ‚Äúthe family in this house loves god, guns, and Trump flag‚Äù (he is single). My grandpa even built a shed and etched something like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt Obamas, it‚Äôs mine‚Äù in the slab. I avoid social media and this is the even first thing I‚Äôve ever felt the need to post on here. 

I‚Äôve always ignored it and just told myself my vote really doesn‚Äôt count anyways, until 2 weeks ago when I finally registered to vote and I plan to vote for Harris. I don‚Äôt care if my vote does nothing to sway the election. I‚Äôm just tired of all the hate created by the Right. Do I think either side cares about me? Not really. I just want to know I did my part to cancel a Trump vote and attempt to end this hate that seems to be growing. It‚Äôs not healthy and I don‚Äôt want my kids to inherit this mess.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I just have to say‚ÄîKamala absolutely nailed it last night. Trump, of course, straight up lied and fumbled his way through the whole thing, and I‚Äôll admit that Kamala dodged some direct policy questions. But she knew exactly how to handle Trump: by getting under his skin. And it worked‚Äîhe was clearly rattled.

Most of the people around me, like my mom‚Äôs boyfriend, her friends, my dad, his friends, my uncles, and my grandmother, are all Trump supporters to varying degrees. Some are passionately involved, shouting at Fox News, while others, like my mom, are more passive. She‚Äôs always been more of a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like either of them‚Äù type, but then she‚Äôd echo the usual talking points: immigration, Trump‚Äôs economy, Biden‚Äôs competency, and so on. It was all just surface-level support‚Äîshe never actually looked anything up for herself, just repeated what she‚Äôd heard, mostly from her boyfriend.

But last night was different. I turned on the debate, and my mom sat down to watch with me. As it unfolded, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúHow do people think he‚Äôs fit for this? Half the time, I don‚Äôt even know if he knows what he‚Äôs talking about.‚Äù

And then, after Kamala‚Äôs answer on abortion‚Äîwhere she talked about women being forced to leave their state for care and being left to suffer because doctors fear legal consequences‚Äîmy mom started crying. She felt so strongly about this issue, having been a nurse for the last 30 years. Her previous support for Trump seemed to crumble right in front of me. She now admits how evil, incompetent, and dangerous this man is to our country. She sees that Kamala wants to bring us together, while Trump is focused on tearing us apart. She even admitted that Kamala has a good head on her shoulders and knows what she‚Äôs doing.

That was such a happy and proud moment for me. Being constantly surrounded by Trump supporters has been exhausting. It‚Äôs disheartening to see so many people buy into the rhetoric. But last night, Kamala changed at least one Pennsylvania voter‚Äôs mind, and that feels like a victory. I finally feel like I‚Äôm not alone in my beliefs anymore, and honestly, it‚Äôs such a relief.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"My husband and I got our ballots in the mail yesterday and we sat down to fill them out. I am very liberal, and he‚Äôs more of a conservative republican. He is not MAGA republican, he just votes that way mainly because he feels it‚Äôs better for his life. It‚Äôs fine. We have a strict no political talk rule in our house. I respect him, he respects me. We vote who we vote for, and he always votes red down the line. I always vote blue. We cancel each other out and it‚Äôs been this way for 13 years.

Last night as I was filling mine in, I glance over and he‚Äôs on who to vote for President. He looks at me and says, ‚Äúwell I ain‚Äôt no fucking idiot, stop looking at me like that.‚Äù And filled in Kamala Harris. I didn‚Äôt know how to react so I guess I just smiled at him and said I loved him. Inside going ‚Äúthank fucking god!‚Äù Lol

I know how he is, but we don‚Äôt discuss these things. I am just very happy he‚Äôs been paying attention. I ran out today to drop them off at the box. To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure if I could have handled it mentally knowing he voted for Trump after everything that‚Äôs been going on.

Edited to add: I‚Äôd just like to clarify since there is a couple of people now saying my husband voted for Trump in 2020, which is not true and I never said he did. He voted for him in 2016. I don‚Äôt think he voted for Trump in 2020, and to be quite honest I don‚Äôt even remember him voting at all in 2020, he didn‚Äôt ask me to take his ballot anyway. 

Either way, my husband isn‚Äôt some horrible person because he votes a certain way you don‚Äôt agree with. Two people can remain married and have different views on things. He made a mistake once, doesn‚Äôt mean he made it twice and I know this time he voted for Kamala. People can grow as individuals and change their views on things, it happens every day all over the world.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I am a 23 year old man and I voted for Kamala Harris in Texas. I didn't think I would. If you asked me a month ago, I'd tell you I was holding my nose and voting for Trump. But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. 

I am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. I realized how much I despise the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. 

I won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the comments. I would like to note, I am well aware that Trump inherited a great situation from Obama and that Biden inherited a pandemic. What really frustrated me was how long the recovery took. I know it was a once in a lifetime event, but I thought we'd get over it faster than this. I could elaborate more on my exact thought process, but what matters is that I eventually decided to trust Harris to get us to where we need to be.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Today I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in Georgia. A few months back, around February/march I was a MAGA. 

Truthfully I was ignorant and didn‚Äôt know the first thing about politics. Never googled a thing. I was brainwashed by my mother who believes in conspiracies. I started to spiral to a point where fear mongering made me consider actually prepping for end times. Until I questioned myself. Why have I been hearing the end is coming for years but it never happens? I vowed I would stop fear mongering if the one I had last heard came to pass. It did.

That‚Äôs when I discovered some debaters on TikTok (shout out to Parker, Harry, Dean and Chris) they made me start to think critically and ask myself why I was believing Trump was our last hope when he‚Äôs committed such heinous acts. I started to fact check and Google search as I learned things from these debates that I was unsure of. Sure enough there was facts to back them up. Quickly, within a matter of a few weeks to a month I realized that I was wrong. What I‚Äôve been hearing from my mother for years was not only baseless but absolute lies. This guy [trump] wasn‚Äôt just bad on a political and economic level, this guy is evil to his core. 

Unfortunately I‚Äôve lost respect for my mother. I‚Äôve tried to show her the truth too but she is actually too far gone. Likely, she will vote to take my rights and freedom away. She will vote against me.

However, I am so grateful I woke up not just in time, but a while before the election. I got to appreciate Biden instead of blaming and hating him. I got to see his charm and love for us. I got to see his EPIC mic drops before walking off stage. Those are my favorite. I also get to see a party filled with peace, love and acceptance. I get to appreciate what Biden and Harris have done. If I had woken up later on, although still good, I would‚Äôve unfortunately seen Joe Biden in a negative light his whole term. I would‚Äôve believed disgusting false allegations about him and devalued everything he‚Äôs worked so hard to do in his presidential term. Once he was gone I would look back fondly wishing I had realized sooner. 

I really owe so much thanks to Parker, Harry, Dean and Chris and one day I hope to write one of their names on a ballot too. Tomorrow when I go to vote, I hope that we will be able to see Georgia go blue again. I hope my vote will make a difference. Most importantly I‚Äôm glad to be on the right side of history üíô

It‚Äôs important to note that due to the nature of their livestreams, they often get bans, so they have multiple other back up accounts in case they get a temporary ban

Highly recommend Harry and Parker‚Äôs TikTok videos! They are great

Dean and Parker went on jubilee as well the episode is ‚Äú20 liberals vs 1 conservative‚Äù or something like that! They debated Charlie Kirk. Dean has also debated other big MAGA/misogynistic podcasters. I believe they are trying to set up a debate with the Whatever podcast currently but as you can imagine, the MAGAs always run.

They‚Äôre truly amazing and inspiring people. They defend women‚Äôs rights and basic human rights and genuinely are passionate about them. At times it can get extremely heated. There‚Äôs always extremely ridiculous maga but they are very well versed and know exactly what to say to them in retaliation.

If you are interested in watching one of their lives but your schedule doesn‚Äôt align, or you just want to rewatch/watch at your own leisure, this YouTube channel reuploads the livestreams!

Mind you, I'm aware that this isn't 100% the fault of democrats in office, since sadly we have many republicans who try to push against any sort of real progress. However, I couldn't help but think that voting didn't matter all that much, and I shouldn't waste my time doing it again. I was really hoping Trump wouldn't win, but that wasn't enough to get me to go to the polls. 

I ended up having a difference of opinion recently though, for three reasons. Firstly, I had a conversation with my sister recently, who works in a hospital, and we discussed how abortion and reproductive rights are under attack. Her and her coworkers have such sad and tragic stories on this topic, seeing girls as young as 12 years old be pregnant. The thought of someone being forced to have a baby in that stage of their life sickens me, and I can't in good conscience not try to do something to prevent that. Secondly, the recent comments on Puerto Rico at a Trump rally absolutely disgusted me, and as someone who works nearly every day with Latinos, I could not stand for someone to be in office whose platform promotes hate against that group. Thirdly, all of these ads I'm seeing against trans people makes me not only sad, but really scared for them. They're being painted as evil, for merely existing and being their true selves. I know if someone in a position of power continues to speak so poorly about them, that will only lead to more violence, and even deaths, whether that be from  murdering trans people or them committing suicide. 

Obviously I'm just one person out of millions and millions of voters, and my impact is quite small. I don't think I did anything that special by simply filling out a ballot. But I wrote this post to make you aware of why I took this course of action, and to let you know what motivated me, incase you have anyone in your life who is either planning on not voting or is on the fence. 

Just hoping what I did today ends up being worth it. ",t2_1c6hjyzn,"I was almost dead set on not voting this year, but ultimately decided to go for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz today",0.98,3357,1730609681.0,1730609681.0,180,capamericapistons,1gifh9o

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Our echo chamber may sound like Kamala has this in the bag, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily the truth.

A group of my high school friends and I just returned from a bachelor party in South Florida.  I live in CA.  My friends are early 30s Millennial white men from GA, TX, FL, AZ, TN, and LA.  About half of these guys have advanced degrees or work as civil engineers on government contracts.  

My story is a warning to all of you that many of your male friends, colleagues, neighbors, and fathers at your child‚Äôs pre-school plan on enthusiastically voting for Trump.  Their main reasoning is *the Economy* and that Kamala would ‚Äúnuke‚Äù it by encouraging Congress to pass an Unrealized Gains Tax‚Äîan idea that has little practical chance of even coming to fruition.  

It‚Äôs a tale of two Worlds.  One is where most of here stand‚Äîan America with an Opportunity Economy that embraces Freedom and the differences between us.  The other‚Äîa society where we remain indifferent, apathetic, and suspicious of those who are different.  They fully believe that a cat being eaten in Springfield should be the focus of this election.  That bringing the working classes to a period of Prosperity is a fool‚Äôs errand and that we are better off pleasing billionaires.  

These voters see Kamala as the biggest *threat* in the room‚Äînot Trump.  The sexism and racism runs super deep to the point they don‚Äôt even see that they are being racist and sexist.  How is a woman who was elected multiple times as District Attorney, Attorney General, Senator, and now, Vice President, more incompetent than the founder of Trump University?  It is suspended logic, but yet here we are.

This wasn‚Äôt just one conversation, but a string of multiple conversations that spanned over the weekend.  People of all demographics are poisoned by the false rhetoric of FOX and Newsmax.  It nearly shattered my heart comprehending that team Kamala still needs to fight, hard! 

This is going to be the closest election yet if the numbers are right.  It is up to us‚Äîand the many Gen Z and Women first time voters‚Äîto change the course of history forever.  To put Trump and his cronies in the dustbin of history.  

This is it.  One month to go.  We still have A TON of work to do in these Sun Belt states.  I just looked at electoral maps the other day, and it‚Äôs a very narrow path of victory if Kamala were to win just the Blue Wall and the coastal states.  

We watched the debate.  We know the Assignment.  Know that nobody in your swing/red state family will know who you truly voted for.  A vote for Kamala is SAFE!  A vote for Kamala is an investment in America‚Äôs future.  Above all else, pray that this election is an inflection point that turns the tide of our country into something extraordinary.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"More than 129,000 voters have registered in Georgia since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, which could be a good sign for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Georgia is among several battleground states that could decide the 2024 election between Harris, the Democratic nominee, and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump.

Polls show the state has gotten more competitive in the two months since Harris entered the race after Biden dropped his bid for reelection on July 21.

The state has seen at least 120,000 new registrants between July 21 and September 8, according to data compiled by L2 Data that Newsweek has reviewed.

Democrats registered more voters in that period‚Äîabout 51,000‚Äîwhile Republicans registered 13,000. At least 64,000 of the registrants are unaffiliated voters.

But the surge of new voters, especially young people and people of color, could give Harris an edge in Georgia, which Biden won narrowly in 2020.

Most new registrants are young; some 56 percent are 34 or under, with 18-year-olds accounting for about 20 percent. More than half (about 53 percent) are voters of color.

Recent polls have shown Harris ""not meeting the level of support from minorities that she would need to win Georgia. To the extent that the ranks of minority voters are increasing at rates greater than White voters, this is potentially good news for the Harris campaign,"" he said.

Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek that the ""surge of voter registrations among youth people and people of color in Georgia can only spell good news for Harris.""",t2_7e3wzgp6,"Kamala Harris Gets Georgia Boost as 120,000 New Voters Sign Up",0.97,3171,1727956682.0,1727956682.0,73,John3262005,1fv5y86

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Idk who this poll worker is, but she was an angel!

I started crying while filling in the bubbles on my ballot-- and I am not someone who cries easily. The full weight of the election hit me. The possibility of more Trump trauma. My fear and worry about my life and marriage and the people around me. My fear we'll lose our democracy. And also so much hope! I want our democracy restored. I want the toxicity to end and people to re-engage with our democracy. I've been making phone calls, knocking on doors in PA, and filling out 500 postcards. And it all came down in that vote for me. And more than anything, watching Kamala and her team (Walz! Doug! Gwen!)  rise to this occasion-- fighting for us selflessly and joyfully-- is so inspiring. This election feels like Obama in 2008 x1000. I want someone in the WH who sees us and knows real people's struggles. And I believe she will work hard for us and move this country ahead. And our first woman president! And a woman of color! HERstory!

So all that hit me hard, and by the time I got to the machine to put my ballot in, I was sobbing. The poll worker helped me submit my ballot and then hugged me. I still couldn't stop crying, so this wonderful poll worker (an older woman, in her Sunday best, giving major grandmother vibes), took me away from the crowd of early voters and held me. She held me like she was my grandmother and said ""I don't know who you voted on but I can guess and I want you to remember that light always pushes through."" And recited some Bible verse about light, hope, and Jesus that I don't remember. I'm pretty agnostic, but she was so comforting and kind, that I calmed down enough to thank her and leave. Then I had to walk out clearly crying past all the people waiting to vote.

But January 6th woke me up. It was like getting unhorsed at a jousting tournament, just *bam* and you are on the ground. I've always been pro-LGBTQIA+ Rights, very strong Women's Rights - although I went back and forth on abortion from ""full rights"" to ""limited"" to ""none"" and back - and back and forth on Immigrants - especially after discovering my birth dad was an immigrant from Scotland with, shall we say, questionable paperwork.

But January 6th woke me up. Even as someone who used rhetoric like ""we need a Caesar"", ""cross the Rubicon!"" It was a shock, in a horrible way. 

And I rejected that ideology.

I'm rapidly anti-Theocrat as well. In the beast 14 years, I've gone from Bible believing, Jesus worshipping, Bible study going to avowed anti-theist, the next step beyond atheist.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"This last week, my wife and I drove from Maine to Pennsylvania to visit family, stopping in upstate New York along the way to visit her step-mom, a VERY religious woman who actually tries to live a christ-life like through Mormonism. She voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

During this visit I was wearing my ""White Dudes for Harris"" cap and she said ""I like your hat!"". At first I thought she was ribbing me a bit, but then we spoke a bit more and turns out that - no, she was being sincere. She then went on to describe an instance where she was watching Fox News, listening to Trump speak about his stance (or lack thereof) on Abortion when - in her words - ""the spell was broken"". She said she finally saw what all the democrats have been yelling about for the past eight years and that she woke up to the idea that this man has nobody's best interests in mine but his own. She said it was like a veil had been lifted off of her and she said she felt foolish for not seeing it sooner.

I think I almost fainted listening to this - this was like hearing my Rabbi had found Christ. I was actually shocked. Eight years of loyalty to Trump, broken in a second because the man just CANNOT understand how much this issue means to so many people. I gave my mother in-law a lot of praise after that conversation and thanked her for being open minded about her past views and who this man really is. My wife's whole family now will be voting for Vice President Harris, which is actually kind of crazy considering where they were in 2016 and 2020.

This gave me A LOT of hope for the future of our country, and I hope it gives you the same warm fuzzies it gave me!

So what's your answer?""

He couldn't give me one until about an hour later when he came back up to me and said he would watch the debate tonight because all he's been watching is fox news.

Edited for the update: So his first question was in defense of the Trump line he toted the other day that Trump was being corrected constantly. ""Okay so they corrected him twice but why did they have to do that when She lied too?""

Me: ""She got a couple numbers wrong and made a hasty overgeneralization. The studio had to correct what he said because they were covering their own a$$'s so they didn't get sued for slander or hate speech.""

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Trump and Harris visited the Augusta, GA area two days apart following Hurricane Helene.

Harris didn't turn her visit into a rally. She got briefed by the Augusta emergency response team, announced more aid, and personally handed out food at a food bank. There was no major traffic pile up or major roads that were blocked for a long period of time. She didn't book an arena. She showed up to do her job and left. No campaigning.

Trump showed up with GA governor Brian Kemp. Because apparently, they've privately made up despite all the horrible things Trump says of Kemp and his family, after Kemp shot down Trump's coup [request](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-governor-kemp-rejects-trump-special-legislative-session/to) to bring a special legislative session to select new state electors and hand Trump Georgia in 2020. As well as the GA Secretary of State's [denial](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1106472863/georgia-officials-fact-check-infamous-trump-phone-call-in-real-timeto) to ""find 11,780 votes"". Not to mention the explicit lies Trump has made of Biden's support to GA that Kemp had to go out of his way to [refute](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-hurricane-helene-3097f1706455929adf5a4eb67f9cdf0fon) on Monday.

They booked the performing arts center in the nice part of town. Had a crowd of Trumpies, some with bandages on their right ear. Trump repeats the BS about Biden screwing over GA while Kemp literally stands next to him and smiles. Kemp takes no questions from reporters to avoid contradicting Trump in the same room.

I20 is shut down for a time and Evans, GA has traffic jams on top of the jams we already have with hundreds of linemen driving around and people trying to get gas, get to work, get around damaged areas, etc. What a guy.

The only upside is how many people in our city's FB group are clowning Trump and bringing receipts. Some of them that aren't Democrats and have ""no foot in this race"" brought up how obvious the difference in obstruction the visits had.

Simon is a smart guy and makes excellent points.  Basically, Trump has recuited a lot of right-biased pollsters to go all in on red-waving this election.  They're not only doing it to state polls, but national polls as well.  They're trying to discourage Democrats from voting, as well as setting up a narrative to make it look like he's winning so that he can use it to challenge the election.

I don't hate anybody, and I believe what happens between consenting adults is none of my business. I used to subscribe to the belief that marriage was only between a man and woman. I'm not proud to admit it, but some of the jokes and comments I've made in my personal life, have been described as misogynist by some of my close friends and family.

I voted for Harris/Walz simply because the other side is errant. Donald Trump does not belong near any office. He is a convicted felon, found liable in civil trial for SA, and has almost 30 SA allegations against him (some of them made by minors!) He could not pass a background check to work at Allied Universal. He could not pass a background investigation to join the military as an enlisted soldier. He should not be anywhere near the position of Commander-in-Chief.

I strongly fear that our democracy is lost if the other side wins this election. I am afraid. But I think there's a movement of voters that are silently voting for Harris because they see what could happen. It might be the SAHM who has a MAGA husband, the Labor union employee or even the cop with MAGA coworkers. Or it could be the chad-types that just won't admit.

  
I hope Kamala Harris and Tim Walz get elected, for the sake of this republic. ",t2_1byafsp9hc,Please read this if you're feeling anxious about the upcoming election.,0.97,2254,1730328539.0,1730328539.0,218,Neither_Nothing_529,1gfzogc

To bring in those voters, this campaign launched Republicans for Harris-Walz, a grassroots organizing program to further outreach efforts to the millions of Republican voters who continue to reject the chaos, division, and violence of Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"A longtime Republican Oklahoma legislator and Heritage Foundation trustee is making waves this week after he endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for U.S. president.

Edwards, whose real name is Marvin H. Edwards, was a Republican U.S. congressman representing Oklahoma's 5th congressional district from 1977 to 1993.

He was a founding trustee of the Heritage Foundation and national chairman of the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference.

In the piece published by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Edwards urged Americans to vote for Harris due to the importance of foreign policy.

He wrote that U.S. allies cannot trust Trump, adding that countries like China, Russia and North Korea are authoritarian and could buy a Trump administration through flattery.

Harris works across the aisle, Edwards wrote, and is a potential president that Western leaders will respect.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Vice President Harris will spend the week hitting the airwaves with a series of major media interviews before heading to the west coast as early voting gets underway.

A senior campaign official said Harris will sit for interviews in the coming days with radio host Howard Stern, late night host Stephen Colbert on ‚ÄúThe Late Show,‚Äù and the hosts of ‚ÄúThe View.‚Äù

Those appearances are in addition to a previously announced sit-down with ‚Äú60 Minutes,‚Äù which will air Monday, and an appearance on the popular ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù podcast that will be released Sunday.

Harris‚Äôs media blitz comes as her campaign has thus far used targeted interviews to reach certain audiences. The vice president has sat for interviews with local outlets in battleground states, and she has done radio interviews and podcasts.

The audiences for her upcoming interviews will likely be larger, though. ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Late Show‚Äù boast millions of viewers daily, Stern has more than 2 million subscribers on YouTube, and Alex Cooper, host of ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy,‚Äù has millions of followers on social media.

Harris will travel later in the week to Nevada and Arizona, the senior campaign official said.

She will participate in a Univision town hall event and other campaign stops in Las Vegas on Thursday, the official said. On Friday, she will travel to Arizona to campaign and urge voters to cast their ballots early.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Please share this like wildfire to attack the republican falsehoods (I apologize for the redundancy) 

A New York Post article claims Tim Walz embellished his military career and suggests he left his unit before their deployment to Iraq. Here‚Äôs why these claims are misleading:

1. Service Duration: Tim Walz served honorably in the Army National Guard for 24 years, retiring as a command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks.

2. Retirement Timing: Walz retired in 2005, which was planned and within the regulations. His unit deployed after his retirement, so he did not abandon his unit.

3. Deployment: The unit‚Äôs deployment to Iraq occurred almost a year after his retirement, indicating his departure did not impact the unit‚Äôs operational readiness.

Tim Walz served honorably and commendably in the National Guard for 24 years, from 1981 to 2005, achieving the prestigious rank of command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. This length of service is significantly longer than the average serviceman, who typically serves between 3 to 6 years or up to 20 years for those making a career out of the military. His dedication is undeniable, having reenlisted after 9/11 to continue serving his country during one of its most critical times. Claims that he abandoned his unit are blatantly false. Walz retired to pursue a career in public service, a legitimate and honorable transition that reflects his commitment to serving the public in a different capacity. He received an honorable discharge, affirming his dedicated service. Fellow guardsman Joseph Eustice has publicly defended Walz, stating he had every right to retire and did nothing wrong. The baseless criticisms against him are politically motivated and fail to recognize the facts. Walz‚Äôs military records and the support from other veterans unequivocally confirm his long, dedicated service well beyond the call of duty. It‚Äôs time to honor his contributions and stop the unfounded attacks on his character and service.

There are claims suggesting that Tim Walz signed different contract lengths and retired before the end of his service. Here‚Äôs a breakdown to explain why he didn‚Äôt abandon his unit:

1. Contract and Retirement:

‚Ä¢There‚Äôs conflicting information about whether he signed a 4-year or 6-year contract. Regardless of the exact duration, it‚Äôs essential to understand that military contracts have specific terms and conditions. Retirement or separation from service is typically an organized process that adheres to military regulations and protocols.
 
2. Timing of Retirement:

‚Ä¢It‚Äôs reported that Walz retired five months before the end of a supposed 5-year contract. This means the military planned and approved his retirement, following standard procedures. His retirement would not have been a sudden or unauthorized departure.

3. Deployment Details:
‚Ä¢The unit was deployed almost a year after he retired. This indicates that the deployment occurred well after his official retirement from the military. Therefore, he could not have abandoned his unit, as he was no longer serving at the time of their deployment.
4. Military Protocol:

‚Ä¢The military ensures that units have sufficient personnel and resources before deployment. If Walz retired following standard protocols, his departure would have been accounted for, and appropriate measures would have been taken to ensure the unit was not left understaffed.

Conclusion:
Tim Walz did not abandon his unit. His retirement was a planned and authorized process that took place well before the unit‚Äôs deployment. The timing of events shows that his departure from the military service was in accordance with established procedures and did not negatively impact his unit‚Äôs readiness or operations. Undeniably, members of his unit were paid to lie (not remotely surprising; MAGA Republicans have never once been honest when they're cornered and have no talking points). Still, even if he did abandon the unit (he didn't, but hypothetically) to oppose an unjust war, Donny the Conny  with his ear boo boo never served with his widdle bone spurs.

I was pretty sure she was a Trump supporter but until recently, everyone at work seems to avoid political discussion. Yesterday she straight up asks me who I'm voting for.  I stutter a bit because I really didn't want to ruin our friendship.  I finally said I'm voting for Harris. She acts kind of disgusted. ""Don't you want tax free overtime?"" I'm an openly gay man which I remind her and tell her it's very important for me to retain my civil rights. I ask if she watched the debate.  She says ""Shut up, Swiftie.""

I don't think she watched the debate.  :P

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"So, I'm a lifelong democrat.  I was raised in a house where there was very little talk about God, but a lot about Franklin Roosevelt, and how his policies saved America and paved the way for the post-war boom.  I didn't really know much about Republicans until Nixon, because I was all of 13 when he was elected..  That was the '68 election, so... IYKYK.... 

I have always believed in the concept that the government has an unlimited responsibility for the welfare of its citizens, and the only measure of a government is the extent to which it's molded to that purpose.  So, I've never agreed with the mindset, exemplified by Reagan's rhetoric, that the government is the enemy of private industry and people's well being.  

Sadly, I'm reliably informed by doctors that this will be my final election cycle.  I'm ok with that, philosophically.  Looking back, I've been gifted a life far beyond any that I deserved, and I'm humbled and grateful.  Part of that life has been spent living overseas, as I am at present, preparing to move back to the US for my final months.

I've watched tanks roll through the streets during elections in Indonesia in the '80s,. I've seen an entire culture of brilliant, hard working Chinese, shrug off the fact that they have literally no say in the affairs and priorities of their government.  Even now, I live in the kindest country on earth, Thailand, but the political system here is so broken that in the 15 years I've been here, the only ""popularly"" elected government that served out it's turn without being overthrown, was a former general who rigged the entire parliament so he could win. 

Politics are nasty, and people who seek power can lack any moral constraints.. I know this.

But, like most boomers ('55, so the end of it), I was instilled with this idea that all that fumbling around with how to be governed was the problem of the rest of the world.  In America, the people decided, the constitution was the law, and that was that... and it was unshakable, 

So, to be two weeks away from an unimaginable election in which a large percentage of Americans are so disillusioned, or just hateful, that the entire democratic infrastructure of the US is at risk, is unimaginable.

So, I'll be here on election day, but my absentee ballot in GA will hopefully make my last election an historic one.

1:37 pm on a Sunday afternoon here in deep red Oklahoma.  Get a knock at my door.. Despite having a doorbell.  Looked through the hidden camera, saw 2 guys and a girl carrying Trump signs and wearing the mark of the beast on their heads.  Yelled through the door ""just a minute"".  Went and got my glock and had it clearly visible.  Opened the door.  "" can I help you?""  

""yes, we wanted to known if you would let us put a Trump sign in..."". And I cut them off "" I'm just gonna stop you right there, this is a private and gated community and I don't know who let you in.  Secondly I'm a board member of the HOA, which is the Homeowners Association if you don't know what that is and its against our policy for political signs in our yards and everyone who displays one will be fined.. Substantially.   I'm giving you ten minutes to go back to the houses you hit before mine and take your stupid signs back.. Then I'm calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing if you are still around..  *look at my watch .. You have ten minutes, I have this all on video * points at my hidden camera and the police will know what you look like.  Now get off my lawn.  (had to do the Clint Eastwood line)

The whole thing was bullshit.  Yeah its gated.. But half the time its open! But I'm not on the HOA because there ISN'T ONE!  Literally watched them split up and start getting the only 2 signs I could see on my street.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Listen. I get it because I've criticized Trump supporters for the same thing. I know it doesn't mean much but:

I live in rural Indiana smack dab in the middle of republican country. TRUMP country. And this morning on my way to work I officially noticed way more Harris/Walz yard signs on the way to work than any other candidate. I drive through 3 towns before I get to work. And I mean it was maybe 80% Harris/Walz, 20% Trump/Vance. This is UNHEARD OF in rural Indiana. 

Something is working. People are noticing. The complicity seems to be ending. Progress is happening. The Trump crowd seems to be getting smaller. Something is happening. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions. But it gave me a little boost of confidence. A little pep in my step and faith in my fellow Hoosiers. I know it doesn't mean anything for the upcoming election, it can still go any direction. But I'm feeling really good this morning and wanted to share.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I am in Indian woman whose parents immigrated to America when I was a child. I grew up in fear about being undocumented. I never expected to have a job. I never expected to be able to vote. I certainly never expected to vote for someone who reflects me to some degree. When Kamala was VP, I honestly did not care very much. I became apathetic to politics after seeing American extremists on both sides make decisions that led to Trump's election. I would finally be able to vote in 2024, but it felt like a duty. There was no happiness, no excitement, just an obligation to do what little I could to prevent Trump/Project 2025.

Then came Kamala. I was reticent. It felt forced, but I was still going to do my civic duty. I started watching her speeches out of a sense of obligation. I tuned into the DNC to see Michelle Obama. I stayed. I watched the crowd and felt the excitement with them. Michelle made me laugh and cry and hope. Barack made me feel like adults are taking back control of the government. Tim Walz made me feel like I was in an episode of Friday Night Lights and I cheerfully exclaimed, ""Yes, coach!""

I have been living with severe depression for years. I cannot express how it felt to experience joy again, especially in something I had given up on. So I wanted to share the joy. I texted my friends. Some were watching and also excited. Some were not, but did when I shared how I felt. One turned belligerent. She ranted at me about supporting the broken political system, used the both parties false equivalency, infantilized me by telling me I don't understand politics. Not only was she angry, she was mean. My intention was just to share my joy, not to convince anyone of anything. Her response was to insult and hurt me. She was on a power trip and thought she could intimidate me into not watching and not voting; into sitting back and doing nothing while this country falls apart. She was wrong. Roe v Wade was overturned. Women and girls are hurting and dying. The Supreme Court is a farce. Doing nothing does not bring about the change of a centuries-old institution and it is more than naive to think so- it is dangerous.

My call to anyone that reads this - VOTE! It IS your voice, even in its imperfection. Your vote DOES matter. It impacts policy, ideas we hold sacred, and the fucking Supreme Court. The idealistic protests will not break the machine. The machine will keep going whether you like it or not. Me? I want someone working in it that at least gives one shit about the things and people I care about.

I am voting for Kamala. I am doing so with excitement, with hope, and yes, with tempered reality. We saw eight years with Obama. Nothing about her presidency will be easy. She may not be able to get the things done that I want her to or that she wants to. But sit this out? Protest because nothing is far left enough? Let a rapist, racist, and rapist (did I mention that?) back into the White House to satisfy and validate my political apathy. Fuck no. And for anyone who is still leaning that way, take a good hard look at where this country is headed. If you want your anarchy and think it will solve problems- do you. But if you want to steer this ship to new lands, you have a civic duty this November. Do it.

Hey all!

Chiming back in for ONE final time before election day tomorrow! This weekend saw a continuous rise in Pennsylvania Democrat mail-in ballot returns and have continued to outpace Republican returns with an increase of +9,000 ballots of separation from yesterday into today.

Additionally, we are seeing that almost a majority of Republican mail-in votes in PA are coming from those who voted in-person for previous elections, meaning that the ""red mirage"" *may* be heavily reduced - we won't know for sure until exit polling tomorrow / when the in-person numbers start coming in tomorrow night.

**So far, Trump needs to find at least 409,000 more ballots tomorrow in Pennsylvania (I thoroughly believe this number will be close to 425,000 tomorrow).**

This is NOT the time to celebrate or to get overly confident. YOU. MUST. VOTE. No matter how long the lines are. No matter the rhetoric. No matter what happens. We stand in line until our votes are counted.

# WE DO NOT STOP UNTIL WEDNESDAY. üíô

I would just like to take the time and thank all the wonderful people I've interacted with over this election cycle. I know anxiety is at an all time high right now, but take a deep breath. Democracy will prevail as long as we vote. We got this.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I have people in my life that are not civically engaged but have opinions that are centrist/center-left in the broadest sense. They are young and some haven't voted before and aren't a fan of Trump. They've disengaged from politics. I asked them what they thought of Harris. Said they didn't know much about her.

All it took was me explaining Harris's housing plan and contrasting it to Trump's ""Housing Plan"" (mass deportation) and I managed to carry the conversation into getting them to check their voter registration and prepare to vote. They'll vote for Harris. I'll be keeping in contact with them and helping them through the voting process. Other topics like p2025 came up naturally much later in the conversation. They had all vaguely heard of it before.

I used Harris's [Economic Policy Book](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf) as my internal guide and explained in plain language her housing section. I didn't read anything off. Just talked about what some of her ideas were. Hate towards firms buying up hundreds of rental properties is common and not a charged topic unless you're a rental landlord.

Talking to disengaged people in YOUR life is more valuable than arguing with Trump supporters or spamming pro-Harris social media. Everyone already knows who Trump is. Introduce people to Harris.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Kamala Harris has significantly narrowed the presidential race in Iowa, cutting Donald Trump‚Äôs lead to 4 percentage points in a dramatic turnaround from Joe Biden‚Äôs double-digit deficit.  

A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows that Trump leads Vice President Harris 47% to 43% among likely Iowa voters ‚Äî a far slimmer margin than the 18-point lead the former Republican president enjoyed over Democratic President Biden in late spring. 

Before Biden ended his reelection campaign, a June Iowa Poll showed Trump leading 50% to 32%.  

This is the Iowa Poll‚Äôs first test of Harris‚Äô strength against Trump since she became the Democratic Party‚Äôs presidential nominee in August. 

The poll puts the race more closely in line with the 2020 election results, which ultimately saw Trump win Iowa by about 8 percentage points over Biden.  

Now, 81% of all Iowans say they will definitely vote in the general election, up from 76% in June. However, some of the demographic groups more likely to favor Harris are showing increased participation.

Like Walz, talk about specific conservative leaders by name. Use terminology like ""Republican leaders"" or ""conservative leaders."" Or conservative media. But avoid casting a wide net with the terms ""Republicans"" or ""conservatives"" used by themselves. Because then you may appear to be attacking the voters. Whereas we want the voters to feel like they are not like Republican leaders and conservative media.

And for those who have not seen the Ezra Klein interview, it is definitely worth a watch. Walz answers questions very conversationally. Very insightful about him.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Vice President Harris on Tuesday called for eliminating the legislative filibuster in the Senate in order to codify abortion rights.

‚ÄúI think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,‚Äù Harris said on Wisconsin Public Radio. ‚ÄúTo actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom, and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.‚Äù

It marks the furthest Harris has gone to date in her pledge to restore abortion rights if she is elected in November.

She has repeatedly said she would sign legislation passed by Congress to restore Roe v. Wade, which was overturned by the Supreme Court‚Äôs conservative majority in 2022.

Harris has made reproductive rights central to her campaign, blaming former President Trump for the end of Roe v. Wade and the restrictive abortion bans subsequently passed by states across the country. Her campaign has highlighted the stories of women whose health was jeopardized and who had to travel across state lines to receive care because of state-level abortion restrictions.

Harris previously said during her 2020 presidential primary campaign that she would back ending the filibuster to pass sweeping climate change legislation.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"My father has been Republican since the 1980s, a young kid manipulated by AM talk radio and the Reagan era. 

Well, he has never voted for a democrat in his life. He supposedly voted independent in 2016, I‚Äôm not sure about that, but he definitely voted independent in 2020 and had no idea who he was actually voting for - all because he was too stubborn and refused to vote for a democrat. 

You wouldn‚Äôt believe my surprise when I spoke to him this week and he told me, ‚Äúfor the first time in my life I am going to be voting for a democrat‚Äù. 

Kamala‚Äôs campaign has ignited hope, optimism, connection, and quite honestly the belief that we can finally move on from hate and MAGA as a country and just have some normalcy for once.

As much as people like my father hate Trump, they were not going to vote for Joe Biden, I absolutely see the tides turning with Kamala and Walz - and it‚Äôs because we finally have two candidates who are energized, competent, intelligent, and simply willing to connect with Americans in a positive way.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"The first-ever mobilization of trans voters around a presidential candidate took place on Zoom on Tuesday, as around 1,000 transgender people, including lawmakers, advocates, health care workers and celebrities, logged on to show support for Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô bid for the presidency.

Trans Folks For Harris was one of numerous identity-based webinars to support Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month. Over the last few weeks, many LGBTQ+ advocates have embraced Harris, touting her decadeslong record of supporting LGBTQ+ rights, and her decision to make Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who transformed the state into a ‚Äútrans refuge,‚Äù her running mate. 

This came just after Advocates for Trans Equality released a report showing that 75% of eligible trans voters turned up to the polls in the 2020 presidential election, compared to 67% of the general U.S. population ‚Äî and that trans voters make up a crucial part of the electorate. 

The Harris-Walz campaign has yet to release any concrete policy plans on civil rights ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, but advocates say Harris and Walz have demonstrated their commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ rights, access to abortion and the rights to bodily autonomy overall. A draft of the Democrats‚Äô platform, which was released in July, outlines their fight to restore reproductive rights, address racial inequalities, and protect democracy.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Hi! I thought I‚Äôd share a little story on me voting for the first time voting. I hope this will motivate a few on helping Kamala win. 

So, I‚Äôm not that much of a politics person, because it can be a very touchy subject. Basically, all of my family is republican to the max. However, they are not extremists, and they despise Trump. I, as well, am also republican too. In 2020, I realized how much of a maniac Trump was, as that‚Äôs when I started to get a *bit* into politics. He handled the pandemic poorly, and said it was a hoax from the democrats. I was disgusted and I supported Biden in 2020 (You may notice that I had a history of being active on r/JoeBiden), but I unfortunately, couldn‚Äôt vote at the time. Then after Biden won, January 6 came, and I was flabbergasted by how Trump was able to get a pass with what happened. Later on, I was a bit disappointed at Biden‚Äôs performance as President, especially his debate with Trump this year. Now that we have Kamala, I have hopes that the democrats can pull this election off very well. 

Me, being a Puerto Rican living in Tampa, I can see that Kamala has a ton of flexibility with Latinos, and I won‚Äôt ever forget when Trump was tossing paper towels at the people back in 2017 after Hurricane Maria. I was furious. 

So with that being said, as a republican that will be voting for the first time, let‚Äôs go on a new way forward and we will never go back :)

But he saw the light this time. I don't think KH wins Texas but can cruz lose ..possible if we all vote and enough true American conservatives vote to save democracy. I am so proud of him today. Trust me i know it was not easy for him to do this.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Title. I just voted early and went with my girlfriend. 



I voted for Harris/Walz, and locally for a Democrat since our Republican candidate, Joe Mastrionni made national news from stealing the mailer from his political opponent on a ring camera. 



At the urging of my girlfriend, I also voted yes for NY's prop 1 which the Republicans are saying allows MtF trans people in girls sports (spoiler alert it doesn't) but enshrines reproductive rights into NY's constitution. I had to research this one a lot, but it seems most of my party's talking points were bullshit. Of course. 


Anyway, I am in NY. So I'm not moving the needle. But if there's a few thousand of me in the swing states I hope this gets done. 


Ever since January 6th, and watching his campaign this time around its blatantly obvious to me that Trump and all those who enabled him are unfit for office. 


I voted straight Dem down the ticket - solely because all of the Republican candidates support him. 



Country over Party. 


Democracy over Facism.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Around 17 percent of the new voters come from the top seven swing states, where the 2020 presidential race was decided by razor-thin margins. Vice President Harris and former President Trump now look headed toward a tight race this November, and a surge of new voters could make all the difference in key states. 

Vote.org has notably registered more than 376,000 voters in the weeks since President Biden withdrew from the presidential race in late July, when Harris launched her fast-tracked campaign.

More than 40,000 voters have so far been registered in Georgia and roughly 37,000 were registered in Pennsylvania, two critical states where polling averages from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ show Harris and Trump separated by less than a point. 

Tens of thousands more have been registered in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada ‚Äì all toss-up states that could decide the presidential race. Several of the battlegrounds also boast marquee races for the House and Senate as both parties fight for control of Congress.  

Young voters under the age of 35 also made up a record-breaking 79 percent of the influx, according to Vote.org, which boasts an 81 percent rate of converting registrations into votes. 

That could be a boon for Harris, who has seen signs of surging enthusiasm among young Americans since launching her bid. An NBC News/SurveyMonkey survey published Wednesday found 50 percent of voters aged 18-29 years old back Harris, while 34 picked Trump.",t2_7e3wzgp6,1M new voters registered through Vote.org,0.99,1276,1725472673.0,1725472673.0,39,John3262005,1f8zyp6

Video of Joe Biden when he was first elected to the senate. He was elected at 29 but took office at 30.

I think most prophetic in the video is when he laughs and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll judge me on my age but on my merits.‚Äù

It was really sad to see a great man picked on by a bully. His decision to step aside is astonishing, I don‚Äôt think there has ever been a more gracious and selfless act in American politics especially in modern American politics. He is an inspiration.

> 
> ***In response to this reporting, Vice President Kamala Harris released the following statement:***
> 
> ‚ÄúThis young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school.
> 
> ‚ÄúThis is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care. Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump‚Äôs actions.
> 
> ‚ÄúThere is so much at stake in this election, including restoring the freedoms that have been taken away from us. If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban, and these horrific realities will multiply. We must pass a law to restore reproductive freedom.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"A new poll shows former President Trump leading Vice President Harris by only 2 points in Florida ahead of what could be a tighter-than-expected race in the red state in November. 

Trump leads Harris with 49 to her 47 percent support in the Sunshine State, according to a Morning Consult poll released Monday. The poll‚Äôs margin of error is plus or minus two points.

Prior to the release of the latest Morning Consult poll, The Hill/Decision Desk HQ‚Äôs average showed Trump leading Harris by 3.3 percentage points. A poll released by The Hill and Emerson College last week showed Trump leading Harris by 5 points in Florida, well within the survey‚Äôs margin of error.

In the state‚Äôs Senate race between incumbent Sen. Rick Scott (R) and former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D), Scott leads by 5 points. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ‚Äôs average shows Scott ahead of Mucarsel-Powell by 3 points.

The latest polling data paints a picture of a tightening race in Florida, which has been dominated by Republicans in recent election cycles. Former President Obama was the last Democrat to win the state by less than a percentage point in 2012. Trump then won the state by just more than 1 point in 2016 and by more than 3 points in 2020. 

The Harris campaign has made a number of recent investments, many of them related to abortion, as the state prepares to vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights into the state‚Äôs constitution. Earlier this month, Harris launched a ‚ÄúReproductive Rights for All‚Äù bus tour in Trump‚Äôs hometown of Palm Beach.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Steps they intend to take regarding ""fatherless homes"":

* Demonize single mothers, stating that single mother homes ""are the most dangerous place"" for children. They plainly and directly claim that children with single mothers are physically and sexually abused, poor, will be criminals, will get pregnant (get someone pregnant) in their teens, are poorly educated, will drop out of high school, and will have behavioral and psychological problems.
* State that children who are living with their biological father will not be physically abused, sexually abused, poor, won't become criminals, won't experience teen pregnancy, will be highly educated, don't drop out of high school, and can't have behavioral or psychological problems.
* Ensure that women cannot get child care and thus will be forced to stay at home. By demonizing them and forcing them to stay home, ensure that they are forced to marry and to remain married at least until the children are of age. Also ensuring that the mother is trapped in the marriage without hope of escape--regardless of the state of the marriage or of the treatment of herself OR the children by the father/ husband.
* Take away the children of single mothers as fast as possible, because a single mother household ""is one of the most dangerous places"" for a child to be according to them. Children must be removed from dangerous homes immediately unless the father becomes involved and stays involved and the mother remains in the home also. Force ""nuclear families"" and no divorce onto all people, no matter what, upon pain of losing your children if you don't--this one also effects MEN whose exes are abusive to their children.

>Working fathers are essential to the well-being and development of their children, but the United States is experiencing a crisis of fatherlessness that is ruining our children‚Äôs futures. In the overwhelming number of cases, fathers insulate children from physical and sexual abuse, financial difficulty or poverty, incarceration, teen pregnancy, poor educational outcomes, high school failure, and a host of behavioral and psychological problems. ***By contrast, homes with non-related ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù present are among the most dangerous place for a child to be.*** HHS should prioritize married father engagement in its messaging, health, and welfare policies.

Page 482 (book) 515 (pdf)

>Eliminate the Head Start program. Head Start, originally established and funded to support low- income families, is fraught with scandal and abuse. With a budget of more than $11 billion, the program should function to protect and educate minors. Sadly, it has done exactly the opposite. In fact, ‚Äúapproximately 1 in 4 grant recipients had incidents in which children were abused, left unsupervised, or released to an unauthorized person between October 2015 and May 2020.‚Äù68 Research has demonstrated that federal Head Start centers, which provide preschool care to children from low-income families, have little or no long-term academic value for children. Given its unaddressed crisis of rampant abuse and lack of positive outcomes, this program should be eliminated along with the entire OHS. At the very least, the program‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine and mask requirements should be rescinded.

.

>Allocate funding to strategy programs promoting father involvement or terminate parental rights quickly. ACYF is currently considering different programs to encourage parents, especially fathers, to engage with their children in foster care. While these program ideas and initiatives are still in the early planning stages, promoting responsible parenthood to reintegrate children or at least ***keep a consistent male figure in the minor‚Äôs life is crucial.*** At the same time, in cases where the ***father*** or mother ***does not make a sincere or serious effort to be involved*** in the child‚Äôs upbringing, **termination of parental rights** for children in foster care **should be swift.**

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign this week began trying to persuade a surprise group of voters: Fox News viewers.

While Fox News is known for its conservative coverage, its viewers ‚Äî particularly during the daytime ‚Äî are more ideologically diverse, and the Harris team wants to reach them.

The Harris campaign on Wednesday began running four spots on the network, a Fox News spokesperson confirmed to Axios.

The ads are largely positive about Harris' life, a sharp contrast with the network's often-critical programming about her.

The Biden campaign ran Fox News ads in 2023 to counterprogram the first GOP primary debate, as Semafor reported.

The Harris campaign directed Axios to a memo from senior leadership earlier this week about its large ad buy in August.

""It is precisely through efforts like this that we will break through a crowded media environment early and make clear the choice and stakes of this election for the voters who will decide it,"" principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said.",t2_7e3wzgp6,Harris campaign targets surprise group of voters: Fox News viewers,0.99,1178,1723774801.0,1723774801.0,67,John3262005,1etdfvy
KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I have always been nervous about the prospect of canvassing and despite being interested in politics 2016, never seriously considered doing it. But one thought just kept nagging at me - how would I feel if I woke up on November 6th and wondered what more I could've done to help the campaign? Also inspiring me to canvass were local democratic HQs in red areas, like McConnellsburg, PA and Westminster, MD. If those people can have enough courage to canvass in Trumpland, I can do the same in my bluer area.

I live in Delaware (the state). Today I canvassed in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, which borders my home county. 

Here's a brief recount of my experience:  
  
-It was very fun being in the Dem HQ with other Harris voters. It was encouraging to see a lot of older white people on Team Harris.  
  
-I canvassed with a guy who had prior experience, which helped me feel comfortable.  
  
-The system we used highlighted specific houses where swing voters are likely to be, such as independents or Republicans who had previously voted for Democrats.  
  
-Surprisingly, the majority of people answered their doors.  
  
-We only had two unequivocal Trump houses. Both were respectful and let us on our way. We had probably six or seven unequivocal Harris houses, most of which said their whole family was pro-Harris. We talked to a few undecided voters who were overall pretty receptive to our chats. They seemed likelier to vote for Harris than Trump in my estimation, but they didn't say so explicitly. Nobody said anything negative about Harris. This was of course a small sample size, but it's interesting to note that the neighborhoods we did were Trump-majority neighborhoods in 2020 (one was Trump +5, another was Trump +20).  
  
-One older man who was a registered independent said he was a lifelong Republican until 2016. He said he was voting for Harris. I told him that I had a lot of respect for his ability to see past his party label and vote for a Democrat. 

-One woman who didn't indicate who she was voting for said her daughter was ineligible to vote due to having a felony. Crazy that she can't vote but someone with 34x as many felonies could win the presidency.

-Another volunteer recounted a story about someone whose house was for Harris, and that a kid away at college was going to register to vote in Indiana. The volunteer told them to register with their home address instead. This is an example of how good canvassing can be; without having to change anyone's mind, we got +1 in Pennsylvania. Don't assume everyone understands how the EC works. 

-We stressed that the economy has been improving and people were generally receptive to that, although we were in a more upscale neighborhood so it's possible other places might take more convincing.  

-I saw gas below $3.00 in Pennsylvania, a very good sign as gas is more expensive there than in Delaware.

-My canvassing partner, who had also canvassed for Obama and Hillary, said he felt very good after canvassing this weekend and was more confident in a victory.

-There were four bozos driving cars downtown with huge Trump flags, slowing down traffic and honking at everyone. I cannot imagine this is effective - if I was an undecided voter, that kind of foolishness would definitely push me away from said candidate. I think they're really validating the ‚Äúweird‚Äù allegations. 

-I got a nice Philly Cheesesteak for dinner while I was in PA and watched the Cowboys lose! Ha!

-Overall, I had a lot of anxiety during the process but it felt good. I would encourage everyone here to give it a shot - it's not as scary as it seems and people with more experience will help you! Any anxiety you feel won't be as bad as what you might feel on November 6th, wondering what you might've been able to do differently.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"Harris will stump with the billionaire investor and former ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban on Thursday in Wisconsin. Cuban is also set to host a town hall for Harris in Arizona on Saturday before linking up with Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, to campaign in Michigan on Sunday.

The flurry of events shows how Cuban, long a vocal Trump critic, is making his views known in the final weeks before Election Day. It also serves as a quasi-rebuttal to Musk, who recently spoke at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and has said he'll host his events in what is considered the race's biggest swing state.

Cuban's campaign appearances come amid speculation that he might aspire to join Harris' administration if she wins the election.

A minority owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, Cuban is well-positioned to help Harris appeal to the business community and the young male voters the vice president's team hopes to reach. Before selling his majority stake in the team, Cuban gained fame for his bold presence on the sidelines at games, a break from the stodginess traditionally associated with sports owners. He also grew his profile over 15 seasons on ""Shark Tank,"" an ABC reality-TV show focused on small-business owners trying to convince successful entrepreneurs to invest in their products.",t2_7e3wzgp6,Mark Cuban will campaign for Kamala Harris in 3 key swing states,0.99,1167,1729225744.0,1729225744.0,28,John3262005,1g69z2u

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"I've heard what everyone has been saying about personal canvassing - i.e. talking to 2-3 people in your life who you think you could get to vote blue. I was somewhat reluctant to try this at first - my parents are lifelong Republicans, though neither of them have ever cast a vote for Trump. Both of them have disengaged from politics since 2016ish, with my dad turning third party and my mom not really voting. I don't live in PA anymore and I decided that I wanted to at least be able to say that I tried to affect change where I could, especially coming from such a crucial swing state. So, a few weeks ago I started talking to my mom about Project 2025, the recent Supreme Court rulings, and all the scary stuff that Trump has been saying in the news in an effort to get her caring again.

And it worked! My 56 year mother just told me that she will be casting her vote for Kamala on November 5th. This will mark the first time in her life that she will have voted for a Democrat for anything. She told me that Trump's vision for America terrifies her and that, after actually looking at the Harris' campaign policy plan, that she agreed with Kamala on more things than she had realized. My dad is unfortunately a lost cause - I tried talking to him about it and he just gave me the ""both sides are equally as bad"" response. But still! It feels good to know that I got at least one extra blue vote. Her response even gave me the courage to try talking to my brother about it too (a typically apathetic voter) and I think there's like a 55% chance that he'll vote blue as well.

I realized though, we‚Äôre nervous because we care so deeply about this outcome, and we‚Äôve been burned before. We need to keep optimism and motivation up.

Here are some facts that are just as valid as a poll of 1,000 carefully selected people across a giant if diverse country:

- Polls have adjusted to avoid undercounting Trump like they did in 2016 & 2020.

- Kamala Harris has received record breaking donations from small donors - and while money is close because of super pacs and Elon Musk - that communicates enthusiasm

- Kamala‚Äôs favorability has skyrocketed as she‚Äôs been in the public eye, as has Democratic enthusiasm. 

- This last point is measurable in the polls that have been adjusted to avoid undercounting Trump. 

- There have been a large amounts of endorsements from key players across the aisle. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs emphasized enough but a coalition of DICK CHENEY to AOC. That matters.

- According to folks on the ground, our ground game is better and in the hands of people who have done it before.

- Early voting across states has been record breaking. It‚Äôs definitely tea leaves but it does speak to support that enthusiasm.

Kamala‚Äôs campaign has reiterated this is a close race and they‚Äôre expecting him to consistently do better across the board: they‚Äôve planned for this.

Kamala has run an incredible campaign, met every challenge and excelled at it. She hired a great team to support and prepare her.

So yes, we‚Äôre nervous, but we have every reason to be nervous because THIS MATTERS. Embrace it, tell yourself to do something, because you know who has been doing a crapload of work since July 21st?

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"My sister is a political question mark. She identifies as a libertarian, but also as an independent, also a conspiracy theorist, and also a right leaning conservative. She wears infowars shirts and homeschools her kids while also preaching about the importance of sustainability and clean living (but doesn't believe in climate change). She wants to go with me see a drag show in Vegas. She graciously hosted a Ukrainian refugee family in her home for a week while her incredibly smart and awesome and sweet (but naive) son had a maga hat hanging up in his room. It's confusing, and we've butted heads so many times to the point where our relationship is like walking on eggshells. She writes in Ron Paul in every election. 

Yesterday, out of the blue, she texted me and shyly asked me if I could maybe send her a postcard. She knows I've been writing them to dem voters. She said she's curious and that I'm a Democrat she can trust to give her information. She wanted to know the reasons I'm voting for Kamala Harris. She was still adamant that she probably won't vote for her, but I put together a very sincere document and sent it to her, highlighting economics, housing, women's rights, taxes, all the ways Trump would make things worse, and all the generally awful things Trump has done that she is unlikely to have heard in her weird media bubble. I also sent her Harris' DNC speech, and copied in the transcript from the very last part, the part that genuinely makes me tear up. I told her that I don't feel safe having another child in a Trump world, that Harris makes me feel safe and patriotic, and that we both want a stable future for our children. I ended with inviting her to help me in giving Trump the middle finger. 

I also told her she never has to tell a soul who she voted for, not even me, and that she can even lie if she wants to, but that if she wakes up on November 6th knowing she did a brave thing that could protect this democracy and beautiful country for our kids, she'll feel so much better than if she had thrown her vote away. It's purely symbolic, we live in a deep red state. But damn it feels good. 

I never, in a billion years, would have imagined my sister becoming dem-curious. And even if it doesn't work, it makes me feel so happy knowing that there are more people like her who could be and have been persuaded in this election. It gives me so much hope.

KamalaHarris,KamalaHarris,"In a national race that by all current measures seems exceedingly close, one small electoral vote could provide the margin of victory. So Democrats have planted a large flag.

Harris and Democratic groups have spent more than $5 million in the district since she entered the race on July 23, and have more than $6 million in ad time reserved through Election Day, Nov. 5, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, on the other hand, had spent only about $95,000 on advertising in the state and had reserved roughly $6,800 through Nov. 5.

Trump and Republican allies had sought another route to victory, namely to persuade the Republican-dominated Legislature to rewrite the state‚Äôs rules and make Nebraska a winner-take-all contest instead of awarding its Electoral College votes by congressional district. Maine is the only other state that awards its votes that way. (Trump won the Nebraska district in 2016, but Joe Biden won it in 2020.)

A Republican state senator in Nebraska took that option off the table on Monday when he refused to bow to pressure from Trump and other Republicans to change the rules so close to the election.

In addition to the television advertising, Harris‚Äô team has 25 paid staffers and three offices dedicated to organizing a district with a population roughly the size of Las Vegas and covering geography larger than Rhode Island but smaller than Delaware.

It‚Äôs that kind of organizing that suggests Harris is committing her fundraising advantage not just to ads, but to neighborhood-level outreach in the district, as well as seven targeted states, said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.",t2_7e3wzgp6,Harris competing for a single electoral vote in Nebraska as Trump fails to get rules changed,1.0,1118,1727303830.0,1727303830.0,26,John3262005,1fphcxx

2.  She says the results are additive.  That is, Harris isn't eroding Trump's support, she's creating her own new base.  In this case, it's the ASTOUNDING 28 point margin she has with women in the poll.  

3. It's crucial to remember who is being polled in Iowa.. white people.  These are basically the same white people who are sprinkled all over Trumpville.  They are white, they are rural, they are mixed educated, they are religious/evangelical.  Other than that, there is NOTHING UNIQUE about the white people in Iowa.

We have to do everything we can to make sure Donald Trump faces a crushing defeat on November the 5th. That Orange fascist felon and MAGA have been haunting this country for damn near a decade. We must make sure that he gets fully defeated.

Jimmy Carter is watching. He got to over 100 years old and we cannot let him down. He fought in WW2 and should not have to see the rise of Christofascism destroy America. 

We progressives, leftists, and even liberals alike need to get together and canvass, phonebank, or even just spread the word amongst all of your friends to assemble a salient coalition to defeat Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Netanyahu wants Trump that win and we must make sure he does not get that wish. Donald Trump may pretend like he is all Mr. Peace and Tranquility but he is about as far from that as possible in reality. 

In reality, Trump would be even more horrible especially when his son in law Jared Kushner wants to build waterfront and luxury property on top of Gaza and push the remaining Palestinians into the Negev Desert.

Vote early, get your friends on board, and let‚Äôs make MAGA cry by ensuring Trump loses a second time.

Released on Sept. 5, the EWTN News/RealClear poll takes a deep dive into Catholic religious and political practices across the U.S. The poll, conducted from Aug. 28-30, surveyed 1,000 Catholics and has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

The study found that 59.4% of Hispanic Catholics plan to vote for Harris in November versus 30.4% who intend to vote for Trump.

Nine percent of Hispanic Catholics said they were still undecided and 1.2% said they would vote for another candidate besides Harris or Trump.

The EWTN News poll suggests that Catholic Hispanic support for Harris is slightly above the support President Joe Biden received in 2020, with 54.9% of respondents saying they voted for Biden in the last presidential election.

Meanwhile, undecided Hispanic voters were nearly evenly split with 48.9% leaning toward Harris and 51.1% leaning toward Trump.

https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ella-emhoff-hat-dnc-2024

Football season is almost upon us. Let's continue what the campaign has done with tying football to Democrats by promoting ""Coach Walz"" as Walz's campaign nickname, Walz's use of football in his speeches, and the presence of football players at the convention.

The campaign needs a good Harris/Walz football jersey. Mainly blue and white, but with a little bit of red to tie it to patriotism. And make it an actual jersey, not just a t-shirt that looks like one.

Then watch conservatives go absolutely ballistic this fall when they figure out Democrats *stole* football from them.

Europe,europe,"As Europeans we're all taught the horrors of World War 2. How it ravaged the continent and bought untold suffering and death to millions.

Europe as a construct was built from the ashes of this world war as a means to prevent it ever happening again.

This film is a stark, painful wake up call for all Europeans that Vladimir Putin has reawakened what we thought would never happen again.

Ukrainians are Europeans, Mariupol is a European city, and this is a film about what is happening, now in Europe in 2024.

If you've ever been in doubt, or you've grown weary of war in the news, let this film be a reminder to Europeans to what Ukrainians are dying to protect us from.

Ukraine,ukraine,"This is breaking news and it‚Äôs 3 AM here in Ukraine so apologies that this is brief.

There was another assassination attempt against Trump. The alleged shooter is Ryan Routh, an American who has previously been in Ukraine. You may see reports that he was a recruiter for the International Legion or served in Ukraine‚Äôs military in some capacity. 

This is not true. He was not a recruiter nor did he serve in the military in any capacity. He did attempt to get foreign fighters to come to Ukraine, especially those from Afghanistan. However he did so without any authority or permission to do so. Random civilians can‚Äôt recruit for the International Legion; they have recruiters in the Legion who do that job.

How do I know this? While I‚Äôve never interacted with him I have known the name a long time and been warned to avoid him. In addition because Protect a Volunteer handles flights for many legionnaires we have a lot of contact with recruiters to verify who needs a flight. Even before today recruiters had told me that he is not a real recruiter and had no affiliation with the ILDU. 

I post this so that if you see this misinformation, you can correct it. It is not Ukraine‚Äôs choice that this person forcefully affiliated himself with Ukraine.",t2_1nag0ize,"If you see news about Ryan Routh who allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump, you may see that he was a recruiter for the International Legion of Ukraine.

In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others. There should be no doubt left in the world that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea.

Putin started three years ago with ultimatums to NATO and attempts to rewrite history, but now he cannot manage without military support from Pyongyang.

Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong Un‚Äôs soldiers to him if he can organize their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia.

For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available. In particular, those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given that opportunity.

An anonymous intelligence official told the media on the 21st, ‚ÄúIn response to North Korea deploying a large number of combat troops to Russia, we are reviewing the plan to send an appropriate number of personnel, including experts in North Korean intelligence and enemy tactics.‚Äù

The official added, ‚ÄúThese personnel would participate in interrogations or provide interpretation assistance if North Korean soldiers deployed to the Ukraine war are captured. They would also handle follow-up measures if any of the soldiers defect and wish to come to South Korea.‚Äù

The government and military believe that if South Korean military personnel are stationed locally, they could provide Ukraine with valuable information regarding North Korean military tactics, doctrines, unit operations, and the psychological state and morale of their soldiers.

It has also been noted that gaining insights into the combat deployment methods of North Korean units would be beneficial for understanding enemy tactics.",t2_3i0ttkss,South Korea push for sending military personnel to Ukraine for the purpose of interrogating North Korean prisoners and receiving defectors ,0.99,6247,1729469672.0,1729469672.0,281,Freewhale98,1g8d18b

Ukraine,ukraine,"Hello friends on Reddit.   

First and foremost, I want to express my deep gratitude to you and your nation.  You've done so much for us, including supporting my unit even here on reddit, and we‚Äôre incredibly grateful for that support. You‚Äôve shaped the world and stood as a symbol of democracy, inspiring many along the way. I know this has not come without hardship, and your strength and resilience mean a great deal to us.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that we, Ukrainians, are closely watching your presidential election. As a leader of the free world, you set the global tone, and sometimes I am not certain you understand the significance of that. I also recognize that there are many critical issues you must address, same as in my country.

I would like to ask that you please envision the kind of world you‚Äôd want our children to play in, in the streets, in the parks, sitting on the benches, playgrounds... and let that vision guide your choice.

This is what led me to become AFU soldier in 2022. For me and for very many Ukrainians, it was that simple, we knew what the russians would do to our people.  So I signed up.  Can you imagine a world where regular people like me did nothing, and russians rolled from Bucha to Kyiv? 

Yes, today‚Äôs world is not perfect but it better then the alternative - defeat of democracy and a darkness that sweeps over the free world.  I'm writing this message from a trench, near my brothers in arms, and despite what I read on Reddit sometimes, I want you to know that those who are actually fighting have not changed their minds about which of these options is better for their families.

Again, thank you, American regular people, for all that you have done from the bottom of my heart.",t2_r6bbb6giy,A view of the American election from my trench on the Ukrainian front,0.97,4748,1730644368.0,1730644368.0,310,Komari-125th,1gio5zl

Han further argued, ‚ÄúWhen North Korean soldiers are captured in the Ukraine war, shouldn‚Äôt we at least provide interpreters? We need to observe what the North Korean military is doing. The Ukraine war is a representative example of what future wars might look like, so the idea that ‚Äòwe shouldn‚Äôt go near Ukraine or provide ammunition‚Äô is wrong.‚Äù

In response, Heo Young, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party of Korea, countered, ‚ÄúJust because North Korea sends troops and weapons to Ukraine, it doesn‚Äôt mean we should engage in the same behavior by sending observers and weapons.

""Ukraine ~~is allowed to use~~ has not been restricted from using Dutch F-16's in Russia"", Dutch Chief of Defense Onno Eichelsheim stated to Dutch national new broadcaster NOS.

""Ukraine can field the materials we provided like the country wants to, so long as the humanitarian rules of war are observed."" He stated, in a deviation from the American position. ""They \[the USA\] have other restrictions, but they also provided other weapon systems. At the very least we have the same approach to ensure Ukraine wins the war. I think we are putting forth all efforts to make that happen.""

The Netherlands has allocated 24 of the jets to Ukraine. Eichelsheim did not disclose how many F16's have been used in Ukraine so far.



The article also discusses operations in Kursk, but I have left those out for concision.

Ukraine,ukraine,"The Air Force disclosed the details of the unique operation to destroy the S-400 air defense system

According to the information of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a Ukrainian pilot with the call sign Jeff on a downed MiG-29 fighter was able to destroy the S-400 air defense system of the occupation army of the Russian Federation.

_What is known about the heroic destruction by Jeff of the S-400 air defense system on the downed MiG-29_

It is noted that Jeff has more than 150 sorties and about fifty launched HARM missiles, guided JDAM aerial bombs.

The pilot managed to destroy more than 10 UAVs of the occupying army of the Russian Federation, enemy air defense positions.

Jeff also worked to cover the ground units of the Armed Forces.

In November 2023, a Ukrainian pilot flew a MiG-29 fighter jet armed with HARM missiles.

His task was to destroy the position of the S-400 air defense system of the Russian occupiers near Donetsk.

The failure of this task would expose the ground units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area to serious danger, since the aircraft of the Russian invaders dropped anti-aircraft missiles on the positions of the Ukrainian military.

30 km from the launch site, Jeff received a warning about an enemy aircraft up to 100 km away.

20 km from the target launch, he receives a warning about the launch of an enemy missile in his own direction, but decides to continue the mission.

**_I'll make it! 10 km to the goal! I have to! If I don't ""knock out"" the S-400, it will work against our fighters, Jeff recalls._**

While gaining speed, he felt a sharp blow to the starboard side from an enemy R-77 rocket.

A series of failures began on the instrument panel. In this situation, Jeff had to either turn the plane away, which in this case would finally fail and start falling, or try to launch missiles.

30 seconds to the starting line. The pilot continues his work. Starts HARM, at this moment the hydraulic system fails, the plane leans to the right.

At this time, the fighter jet of the criminal army of the Russian Federation fired another missile. The height is 300 meters, the slope is increasing.

On the downed plane, Jeff decides to fire another missile at the target.

_The plane finally loses control and falls. The pilot quickly remembers all the boys' mistakes during the ejection, quickly says goodbye to the plane, asks for its forgiveness, closes his eyes and pulls the catapult handle. A second enemy missile flies into the plane, the Air Force says._

It is emphasized that the Ukrainian pilot managed to land as safely as possible on moist, soft ground, but in an area 26 km from Donetsk, where many enemy DRGs and special forces of the occupation army of the Russian Federation are stationed.

**_Points of attention_**

- _The Ukrainian pilot Jeff successfully destroyed the S-400 air defense system of the Russian occupation army while flying a downed MiG-29 fighter, showcasing high professionalism and courage amidst intensified hostilities._

- _Despite facing a series of challenges during the operation, including missile attacks and hydraulic system failures, Jeff managed to land safely on moist ground, preventing catastrophic consequences._

- _In addition to the destruction of the S-400 system, Jeff also destroyed the S-300 air defense system in a separate operation, highlighting his exceptional combat skills and determination to protect Ukrainian ground units._

- _The pilot's achievements include conducting over 150 sorties, destroying more than 10 enemy UAVs, and displaying exceptional aerial combat capabilities by launching multiple missiles against enemy air defense positions._

- _The successful operations carried out by Jeff underscore the heroism and dedication of Ukrainian military personnel in defending their country against the Russian occupation forces._

[When] Jeff landed ... [he] took off his mask and overalls, ran to the windbreak forest, and called his brother-in-arms to tell the geolocation. At that moment, his wife wrote to Jeff about her backlog at studying.

The Ukrainian defender smiled and thought to himself: ""Well, you've had a problem there"". But he replied seriously: ""Hang in there, everything will work out, you're strong.""

Jeff is very young. He's only 26 years old, but he is already an experienced pilot. He entered Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University in 2015 when his father was on a long rotation in the Luhansk region.

Jeff says that he and his brothers-in-arms have been waiting for more modern aircraft for a long time. 

""We started training in 2015, when the war was already going on. We were being trained. We knew we would be fighting. We are ready to fly 3-4 or even more sorties a day. We are ready to take risks every day. But we need weapons! Lots of weapons! Modern weapons! This is not a whim at all. This is a vital necessity! 

To be honest, the F-16 of this modification that we will receive is not exactly what we dreamed of. However it is a much more versatile combat platform that can launch a wide range of weapons, and it has better technological capabilities. I wish we had received the F-16 earlier... My bravest and strongest friends laid down their lives on Soviet aircraft... which were on the verge of physical deterioration... We will win in any case, but with F-16s it will be faster!""

> _Jeff landed as well as possible. On damp, soft ground. But the area was, to put it mildly, so-so. 26 kilometers to Donetsk, lots of subversive groups, Russian special forces._

> _... I took off my mask and overalls and ran to the windbreaking forest zone. I immediately dialed my brother-in-arms Smereka [a call sign, that means = –∞ spruce tree]:_

> _- ""I jumped!"" Jeff shouted into the phone._

> _- What do you want? ""Hold on, my wife is calling, it's the kid's birthday today!"" Smereka said in his sleep._

> _- I've been shot down! Call the PRS!"" Jeff brought his sleepy comrade back to life, ""I'm sending the geolocation!"" and buried himself as deep as possible down in the ground._

> _... ""Come here, we are your friends, everything is fine..."" It was the occupants who rushed to look for the pilot. They were searching, combing the forest strip..._

> _... ""The studying is a complete mess! There are so many assignments, I don't know how to take it all""... - and this was his wife's letter. Jeff smiled and thought to himself: ""Well, you've had a problem there"". But he replied seriously: ""Hang in there, everything will work out, you're strong.""_

> _He came out of the hiding place, and looked around the forest belt - ""All clear""._

> _He ran a few kilometers to the geolocation he had sent to his brother-in-arms.
He took a breath and hid again._

> _When the rescuer, who was ""parked"" some 10 meters away, whispered: ""Where are you? I can't see you!"", Jeff quietly came out of hiding and slapped him on the shoulder: ""I'm here, let's go!"" ""Wow, you dug deep! Respect,"" he heard in response!_

Ukraine,ukraine,"Anastasia Trofimova, who previously produced ""documentaries"" for Russia Today (also known as RT - the russian state propaganda arm whose staff were indicted for clandestine manipulation of western social media earlier this week), has debuted her new film *Russians at War*.

Filmed in occupied Ukraine during russia's illegal invasion, it depicts a Kremlin-approved perspective on the russian army's activities and gives a platform to the same ahistorical lies that seek to legitimize russia's genocide of Ukrainians.

In producing the film, Anastasia Trofimova spent months in Ukraine while living with the russian army, which she (laughably) claims was not sponsored by the russian state.  Even the existence of the film itself, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival, has the effect of legitimizing the filmmaker's own long list of crimes in violation of Ukrainian law.

**This reputation laundering propaganda was co-produced by Canadian taxpayers: $340,000 of the film's budget was provided by an organization that receives public funding.**

*Trofimova's statements during the press coverage of the film:*

>""They start to fight because they lost someone. And it's maybe a question of revenge.""

>""I didn‚Äôt go there with prejudgement.  Of course, I had all these stereotypes in my head that I got from reading Russian and Western media.  But I didn‚Äôt judge.""

**A soldier in the film openly denies the accusations that russian troops are committing war crimes.  Trofimova says that she ""did not see any such crimes.""**

>""I think in Western media, that's what Russian soldiers are associated with at this point, because there were no other stories.  This is another story.  This is my attempt to see through the fog of war and to see people for people.""

Ukraine,ukraine,"This is a letter written by u/luciferlol_666 who is a foreign fighter in Ukraine. The original post is in the r/ukraineforeignlegion subreddit but he asked me to share here as well.



I don't know how to properly make this post and have been conflicted for days about it. So, fuck it, here it goes.

I am mentally and emotionally invested in Ukraine winning so for the last two years i have largely been supporting people coming to Ukraine to help in combat ops.

For a long time I insisted on prior military only. I felt, and still do feel, that the training you will get in Ukraine is not even remotely adequate to the risk you will encounter. The Legion also briefly felt the same but then decided to accept almost anyone. The fitness standards are laughable if you came from a branch that took things like this serious. I was in the US Marines so maybe I got used to the bar being set high. In addition to this I wanted ONLY people with a good foundation on weapons handling skills to be around me and my colleagues. I didn't want to die from a negligent discharge.

But....I have met a LOT of people that turned out to be AMAZING soldiers and they came with no prior experience. Their trait that they had that the others didn't, they were coachable and had a genuine interest to learn from the people with experience. They didn't just decide they knew everything after their 2 or 3 month crash course. They also came fit and got more fit.

I have been military for over 20 years and I still train on things I've done 100s of times before. CQC, land warfare, field medicine, etc all are basics that not only are things you become unpolished in a short time, but also these skills evolve as more effective methods are developed. Now add in more continuation training for your specialized tasking, sniper, sapper, team lead, mortars, etc.

So what the fuck am I talking about, get to the point....

This is now a drone war and we are inadequately trained and equipped to face one. The commanders are often trying to use us as if this isn't a drone heavy war. We have lost a lot of people due to the use of tactics that worked better early in the war, but not so well now.

The war here has evolved but the training for us has not and there are massive gaps in capability to kill us vs our capability to survive. The protective equipment and dispersion of it is not adequate to combat the threats you will face.

I had never imagined that the level of commercial off the shelf drones like DJI and hobby built FPV drones being used like they are now. If you have been watching this sub and the many russian Ukrainian war subs you have been exposed to a shitload of videos of people on both sides being killed by drones. It's hard to tell because of the slow creep of how much you're exposed, but we see way more of these now than we did a year ago.

The reason you ask? Because there are absolutely a fuck ton of drones.

Most of what you probably see is russians being killed. But this is due to the bias most of reddit feels. They like to post russians being killed, but not Ukrainians. I feel the same way. But don't let this fool you into thinking these deaths are one sided.

russia has an absolute shitload of these drones and is sending them one after another. On my last rotation there wasn't a 15 minute period where I didn't have one in audible or visual range.

In the overall picture, again, what the fuck am I talking about?

Our tactics, as infantry, to deal with these drones are limited. The Legion, and any other unit is having a hard time dealing with these. russia is too.

If you're infantry, and you're being sent out without very nice EW systems you've tested and KNOW VERY WELL THAT THEY FUCKING WORK, you will likely die. It's just a matter of time.

So I encourage you, that if you want to come to Ukraine, learn some new skill sets and bring your own equipment so you have a chance to be in a better position to survive.

I will make a list, but remember, these things change quick. Your signal jammer may work one day because the russians are using a 2.4ghz frequency. But the next day they may be using a different band that your jammer can't touch. So pay attention to OSINT pages about drones and make sure your command is giving you real time updates, which they almost certainly will not. Also, the drones may move from analog to digital or have terminal guidance like GPS, laser, or even AI. So expect your expensive equipment to be obsolete maybe before it even arrives.

So, the things I think you should do if you want to come here and survive.

1. Fieldcraft. you need to be a capable basic soldier first and foremost. This includes your equipment. Buy nice shit. Blast belts, lvl 4 plates, light weight and comfortable helmet, ballistic shirt, good light weight boots, good ruck, dual tube night vision, good everything. Things that will keep you alive in a drone and artillery heavy war. Wear this shit, a lot, and on long walks, before you come here. Also, be in fucking shape. Come here as an athlete. You want to be in a war like this, be professional.
2. Learn about drones. All about them. Frequencies, how to build them, the sounds of them, how they work, common capabilites, future or imminent capabilities, how to stop them electronically, how to stop them mechanically, how to avoid detection by them, and whatever else you can do to nerd out completely on this subject.
3. Learn how to fly drones. This is the future of warfare and it's here now. Want to make a big impact and kill a lot of bad guys....get very very good at flying drones. Go to a school and get a cert. Ukraine has some schools you can attend for a fee. It's worth doing. This will allow you a much bigger chance to stay more safe than doing zero line assaults or sitting in an OP waiting to be shelled. You will probably not last long without injury or death. I've seen a lot of guys get killed on their very first fucking mission.
4. Have your own drone suppression. Drone jammers come in many forms and I'm currently far from an expert. Learn what works and find a way to get one funded for you. Passive jammers seem to be ideal, but keep in mind directional finding since you're transmitting a signal. Do it too long or too hard and you'll attract attention and be shelled. Same goes if you take a cell phone into the field. You will be triangulated and targeted.
5. If you are not prior military, join your military first. This war in ukraine will unfortunately not stop soon. Go get some adequate training and leadership capability in a NATO military or whatever your country has to offer.",t2_1nag0ize,This is a letter from an American Marine vet fighting in Ukraine. He advises people not to come without military training; join your own country's military first. This has become a drone war.

**Russia Places Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on Wanted List Amid Escalating Tensions**

Russian state media reported on Saturday that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been placed on Russia's wanted list, citing the interior ministry's database‚Å∏. Alongside Zelenskyy, his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, also features on the same list, both facing unspecified criminal charges. Additionally, Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, is wanted by Russian authorities.

Despite the inclusion of these Ukrainian figures, Russian officials have not provided immediate clarification regarding the specific allegations against them. However, independent Russian news outlet Mediazona claims that both Zelenskyy and Poroshenko have been on the wanted list since at least late February‚Åπ.

In response to these developments, Ukraine's foreign ministry swiftly dismissed the reports of Zelenskyy's inclusion. They characterized it as evidence of ""the desperation of the Russian state machine and propaganda"" in an online statement published on the same day¬π¬π.

**Kaja Kallas and the Monument Controversy:**

Russia's wanted list extends beyond Ukrainian individuals. Among those listed is Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of NATO and EU member Estonia. Kallas has been a staunch advocate for increased military aid to Kyiv and stronger sanctions against Moscow. Her inclusion on the list is related to Estonia's efforts to remove Soviet-era World War II monuments within its borders. These monuments have been a point of contention, with some considering them symbols of past oppression. Other NATO members, including Latvia and Lithuania, have also taken steps to remove similar monuments‚Å¥.

The situation underscores the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with broader implications for international relations and security in the region. As the conflict continues, the actions taken by both sides remain closely scrutinized by the global community[^10^].

Russia,RussiaUkraineWar2022,"If you look at the maps, the war in Ukraine is positional/static lately. Russia currently has the iniatiave and choses to attack 'everywhere' for marginal gains. There have been no major sweeping operations of either side for months. The offensive towards Karkhiv came to a stall very quickly for example. Overall the frontlines are barely moving.

In the mean time the war in Ukraine has been going on now for 2.5 years, with staggering losses for both sides, which we have not seen in armed conflicts in decades.

 

Russia's invasion was frontloaded but didn't succeed to overrun the Ukranian defenses quickly, failing to capatilize their operational iniative and other advantages in the early stages of the invasion. On the other end the Ukranians have so far not succeeded in decisively defeating and pushing out the Russian forces despite extensive western support. Resulting in a war of attrition.

 

Now I am wondering if we are actually seeing Russia loosing a war of attrition.

 

On the Ukranian end;

- If we look at the confirmed loss data (F.e. Oryx) versus the pledged support for Ukraine, it seems the Ukranian material levels are actually rising in 2024.

- If we look at the ammunition levels for Ukraine, it seems that the worst crisis is over as increased UKR, US and EU ammo production is coming online and having direct effect on available ammunition stocks in Ukraine.

- It seems the worst of the force generation issues for Ukraine have been addressed, with the new conscription laws being in place, and even talks about parallel force generation of 'Polish' and 'Czech' ukranian brigads.

 

On the Russian end;

- If we look at the confirmed loss data (F.e. Oryx) versus the confirmed production of new equipment (f.e. T90 MBT's) and reactivation of old USSR stockpiles, it appears that the Russian losses far outstrip the new production, and that stockpiles of old USSR equipment that can pratically be refurbished are running on an end.

- It seems Russia is in need for ammunition, as it is forced to turn to North-Korea to supply ammunition. This suggets that current Russian ammunition production is not able to keep with demand, and the (huge) USSR ammunition stockpiles are depleting or gone.

- It seems Russia is facing challenges in force (re)generation in the extend that there is an ongoing struggle to attract new recruits by offering increasingly higher signing bonuses. The available pool of manpower has always had some issues due to the age demograhic, and is under increased pressure by an excodus of young and educated russians at the start of the war, and a surge in requirements for the labor market. Ironically, The army seems locked within a 'wage war' of personel with the arms industry.

 

So this made me wonder.

Are we actually experiencing a Russia that is loosing a war of attrition?

 

TLDR: The current stalemate aside, looking at the numbers it seems like Ukraine's forces are stabilizing or even improving/growing. Russia on the other end seems to not be able to keep up with it's armies demands. Is Russia losing a war of attrition?

> Traditional radar systems are typically stationary, mounted on fixed platforms like buildings or tripods. However, OTM systems are designed to perform even when mounted on mobile objects, like vehicles or ships.

> Robin‚Äôs 3D drone radars, IRIS, are designed with the explicit purpose of detecting small, fast and elusive drones.

Russia,RussiaUkraineWar2022,"From the article:

""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) confirmed the death of Carlos Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Mendoza, a 20-year-old Mexican man from Guanajuato, who lost his life in Ukraine while fighting as a ""volunteer"" for the country's forces in the conflict against the Russian Army. Relatives of the young man from Guanajuato reported that Gonz√°lez Mendoza joined the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine just a month before his death. Carlos Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Mendoza lost his life during one of the most intense aerial attacks perpetrated by Russia on Ukrainian territory since the start of the conflict in February 2022. The offensive, which used around 200 drones and missiles, resulted in the death of at least seven civilians. According to European media, the news of the young Mexican's death was initially reported on a Telegram channel that reports on casualties caused by the Russian Armed Forces. Later, journalist Gia Santos, a contributor to UkraineToday and other media outlets, confirmed the Mexican's death. Sarah Ashton-Cirillo, a former sergeant in the Ukrainian Army, also confirmed the young Mexican's death, stating that he had volunteered to fight in Ukraine and was the first Mexican military personnel to die in this conflict. The Russian Embassy in Mexico had previously reported that it identified eight Mexicans in the International Legion of Ukraine, labeling them as ""mercenaries"". Three of them are believed to have been killed, according to the same source. The SRE reported that ""the Mexican Embassy in Ukraine will support the family of the fellow citizen in carrying out the necessary procedures for the recovery of the body and its eventual transfer to our country"". Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes that Gonz√°lez Mendoza did not belong to the Mexican Armed Forces and offered its condolences to the family for this loss.""

The inclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Kremlin's ""wanted list"" highlights what Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes as ""the desperation of the Russian state machine and propaganda."" The list serves as an online database of individuals accused by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs of criminal activities. Although Russia has stated that Zelenskyy is wanted ""under an article of the criminal code,"" specific details have not been provided‚Å∑.

Since the outset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has allegedly sought to assassinate President Zelenskyy. Russian President Vladimir Putin even called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow him‚Åπ. Notably, Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was also added to Moscow's wanted list for her perceived ""desecration of historical memory and hostility towards Russia""¬π¬π.

In response, Ukraine's ministry emphasized that Moscow's actions are merely attempts to gain attention. They contrasted these ""worthless Russian announcements"" with the International Criminal Court's (ICC) real and enforceable warrant for the arrest of Russian leader Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges. The ICC's jurisdiction spans 123 countries, making it a significant legal development‚Å∑.

Please note that while the ICC's arrest warrant for Putin exists, its practical impact is limited due to jurisdictional constraints. Russia is not an ICC member country, and the court lacks the authority to physically apprehend suspects. However, the warrant may have other implications, such as restricting international travel for the Russian president¬≤‚Åµ.‚Åπ

Israel,Israel,"Indro Montanelli, 1960.


On behalf of the ""Corriere della Sera,"" I spent two weeks in Israel. I had never been there. Or, rather, I had been there a couple of times in my travels in the Far East, but I had never stopped there. This time my intention was to quarter myself in Jerusalem and, with the help of my Israeli friends, who know more about this subject than anyone else, study the whole situation in the Arab countries, which surround and threaten the new Jewish state. 


But, after a couple of days I had abandoned the project, in fact I had completely forgotten about it, all caught up as I was in the interest that local things aroused in me. And, instead of staying in the capital poking around in the archives of the Foreign Ministry and gathering the confidences of the various intelligence services about what was happening across the border between the Nassers, the Kassems and the Husseins, I spent my time wandering through the fertile plains of the upper and lower Galilee and the Negev desert.


The fruit of my observations are the articles that appear in the ""Corriere della Sera,"" and I do not intend to duplicate them here.
 I just want to explain to my readers of the ""Sunday"" why Israel made such an impression on me that I set aside the program I had mapped out before coming there and on which I had also made a definite commitment to the newspaper. 


And the reason is this: that finally in Israel I saw documented in facts a truth in which, underneath, I had always believed, but of which I lacked proof: namely, that it is not countries that make men, but men that make countries. 


So that when we say ""developed zone,"" we must imply energetic and active men and peoples; and when we say ""depressed zone,"" we must imply depressed men and peoples. All other reasons for depression - climate, hydrography, orography, etc. - are merely convenient excuses when they are not even the result of human incapacity and sloth.


Israel, as long as it was an Arab country, that is, until about thirty years ago, was exactly like Egypt (without the Nile), Jordan and Saudi Arabia, with which it borders: a barren and thirsty heath, without a tree, a succession of yellow and stony hills, on which the goats had devoured every last blade of grass and of which the uncontested lords were the crows and jackals. Such areas in the country are still there, mind you, here and there, in patches. They are the ones where the Arabs have stayed. They have water, now, because the Jews went after it in the Jordan River and Lake Tiberias. And with a system of aqueducts from there they brought it to irrigate the whole country. And they also have tractors, because the government gives them tractors. And they also have the assistance of technicians, because the state provides them. And they even have, all around them, the example and the practical lesson of how to turn a barren and inhospitable land into a paradise of citrus groves, pine and cypress forests, lush vegetable gardens, wheat and cotton fields. Yet, they take little or no advantage of it.


Their villages have remained dreadful hemlocks, their
still-nailed plow merely scratches the surface of the earth without bothering to recreate a ""humus"" on it, their axe ruthlessly cuts down trees, and their goats nip in the bud every hint of vegetation. They are by no means ""the children of the desert,"" as they are called in the rhetoric of those who, of the Arab countries, know only ""The Arabian Nights."" They are its fathers. They are not the victims of an inclement climate: ""they are the ones who caused and aggravated it, especially by destroying the forests. And if they suffer thirst, it must be said that they have brought it on themselves by giving up through sloth to regulate the waters, to retain rain in reservoirs and redistribute it with canals. 


I finally understood why the Arabs hate the Jews so much. It is not race. It is not the religion, which sobers them against them. It is the indictment, it is the condemnation, that Jews represent, in the eyes of the whole world, here in their own lands, against their sloth, their lack of goodwill, commitment to work, pioneering enthusiasm, organizational intelligence.


For Israel proves that this is precisely what the depressed areas of the Middle East lack. It is the people who inhabit them, not nature or the good Lord, who made them so. the Jews took them as they were, that is, as other countries all around are: with that scorching sun, with that lack of atmospheric precipitation, with those sand dunes, with those desolate brugheires, with those mosques, with that malaria. 


And in thirty years of hard work, each individual postponing his own individual gain to the interest of all, each generation, sacrificing its own convenience for the sake of the next, of the Palestinian depressed area they made the Po Valley. 


Today this country is in the midst of an overproduction crisis. It no longer knows where to put its wheat, its eggs, its chickens, its cotton, its oranges and its grapefruits. Its milk production is proportionately the second largest in the world, beaten only by that of the Netherlands: which means that from the stony ground it has also drawn wonderful pastures. In thirty years it has planted over thirty million trees, and anyone who dares to touch one goes to jail.


And the climate in thirty years has also changed, because of the forests and irrigation. It was this marvelous human adventure that mesmerized me, overshadowing my interest (and unfortunately the newspaper's as well) in Middle Eastern politics. 
For it answered precisely, with resounding and indisputable facts, the question I had always asked myself: namely, whether it is countries that make men, or men that make countries. 


My friends, it is men who make countries: men and only men, their will, their toil, their ability to believe and sacrifice for what they believe. Depressed areas exist only there, in their resigned souls, in their sluggish muscles, in their indolent brains, in their renunciation of struggle, in the morality of ""getting by"" and ""who makes me do it?"" in short, in the lack of a religious sense of life, and thus in the disposition to derive only immediate profits and enjoyments from it.

Israel,Israel,"Christian Lebanese here, I've previously expressed my support here for Israel's actions in defending itself against the terrorist organization Hezbollah, and today, I stand firm in that position. I believe in the right of any nation to protect its people from terrorism and violence, and Israel's response to these threats is both just and necessary. The suffering caused by extremist groups like Hezbollah, does not represent the will of the Lebanese people. They act as agents of chaos and destruction for Iran.

I send my heartfelt thoughts to the people of Israel during these difficult times. May peace and security prevail, and may those who seek to undermine stability in our region be held accountable for their actions.

Israel,Israel,"On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a genocidal terrorist attack that included the murder of more than 1200 people and the taking of more than 250 hostages. October 7 was the most violent attack targeting Jews since the Holocaust, and included torture as well as the weaponization of sexual violence.

After 10/7 Israel initiated a war against Hamas and the other terrorist groups that the IRGC of Iran has fueled to destroy the Jewish state. Over the year since we have witnessed the downfall of Hamas‚Äôs and Hezbollah‚Äôs leaders.

Israel,Israel,"Some background about what I'm going to write. I've always been a leftist, and because of this, when I was younger, I was exposed to the beliefs and biases of the people I used to hang out with. ""I stand with Palestine"" is the most common view among the left, and being young with no critical thinking and fact checking skills, I would tend to confirm the biases I was influenced by. My critical thinking skills when I was young and stupid were so poor that I would also believe in conspiracy theories back then, but that's another story.

Living in a part of the world (Europe) that isn't really affected by what happens in Israel, I wouldn't give too much attention to the news coming from there during the past 10-15 years, and during those years, I've never properly informed myself about the conflict. When I saw the news of the 7th of October 2023, I felt sad for what happened, but the way that it was presented in international news didn't do justice to what actually happened there. The operation in Gaza to eliminate Hamas and find the hostages started soon after that, and again, the way it was presented in international news made me think that the response was disproportionate.

Anyway, several weeks ago I've started lurking this subreddit, because I was curious to see the point of view of Israelis. I've seen videos of testimonies by freed hostages that are hard to find if you don't actually search for them. I've started doing a bit of digging, and I've seen videos of the aftermath of the massacre, of people being hunted and killed in the street during the attack, and videos made by terrorist as they went inside people's homes, searching for people to kill. I've seen videos of the tunnels, of the conditions in which Hamas keeps hostages. I've informed myself of the way the IDF carries the strikes, of how they give evacuation warnings before carrying them and how Hamas forces people to stay there anyway, very different from the ""genocide"" narrative of international news.

I've seen videos of Al-Jazeera reporters interviewing Palestinian civilians cursing Hamas, and complaining that most of the help that gets there from the international community ends up in the hands of Hamas (and of course the camera and microphone get moved away immediately after those statements). I've seen videos of statements by terrorists captured by the IDF, as they describe how they went inside homes and massacred people in such a casual way as if they were talking about the weather. I've informed myself about the history of Israel and the conflict, of what actually happened between the end of the 1800s and today, looking at the facts alone, and now I see.

I now fully support Israel. I hope the IDF successfully completes the operations that it's carrying and neutralises Hamas, Hezbollah, and every other terrorist organisation in the Middle East, and that once it's done, I hope that it can give closure to the families of the victims of terrorism and of the IDF personnel killed in action.",t2_4tw22mjf,"I used to ""stand with Palestine"" when I was misinformed.

Israel,Israel,"Saved dozens of soldiers on October 7: Hamid Abu Arar received permanent residency in Israel
On October 7, Hamid and his wife were shot in their car by terrorists and his wife was murdered. Despite the injury, he contacted the IDF, risked their lives and saved dozens of soldiers. ""We declare that you are an inseparable part of the State of Israel,"" Minister Arbel told Abu Arar. ""You and your children are an inseparable part of Israeli identity""

Interior Minister Moshe Arbel on Wednesday granted permanent resident status to Hamid Abu Arar, who lost his wife and risked his life in the envelope to save the lives of dozens of soldiers on October 7. ""The Interior Ministry thanks you and declares that you are an inseparable part of the State of Israel,"" Minister Arbel told Abu Arar. The message that you and your children are an inseparable part of Israeli identity is good news for the state and all its citizens.""

Abu 'Arar, a father of nine, now lives in Ar'ar, in the Negev.

In the October 7 attacks, Hamid and his wife were shot in their car by Hamas terrorists and his wife, an Israeli civilian, was killed and Hamid was wounded. Shortly after the incident, despite his injury, Hamid contacted IDF soldiers and warned them of the terrorists, risking his life, thereby saving the lives of dozens of soldiers. Following his wife's death, Hamid was left to care alone for his nine children, Israeli citizens, minors, some of whom have medical challenges.

The opinion submitted to the minister by the committee stated: ""This is an applicant who experienced one of the worst terrorist incidents known to the State of Israel and whose pregnant wife was murdered in cold blood by despicable terrorists before his eyes. In such a case, the State of Israel cannot remain indifferent and not be involved in the fact that this is a family unit that includes nine minor children, citizens of Israel who were left orphaned by a mother and the applicant remains the sole backbone for his children.""

Israel,Israel,"I attended the 7/10 memorial in Prague last night and I heard a lot of hebrew amongst Czech.

It was a weird day in general. I'm not Jewish, maybe couple generations ago, given the history of the Czech Republic, but all of this has been hitting quite close to home for me. And I'm not really sure why. Maybe because of the Jewish history in the Czech Republic. I met my first Holocaust survivor when I was 15 and it stuck with me. Now nine years later I'm lost for words almost. 

At the memorial last night two American tourists came to stand next to me and for about 10 minutes were talking how Israel just wants that land and wants to get rid of the people in Gaza. This was all while the names of the poor people who died were projected on the stage. I just couldn't hold it, I know I should have kept my mouth shut, but I just couldn't, especially on the anniversary of 7/10. I apologised for interrupting and told them that Israel just wants their people back and to get rid of H@mas. I was met with what about ism and if it's okay to kill people. No, of course not. Is it okay to kill 1200 people in one day? I was shown hand gestures that I only know from American films xD. I haven't met such a childish person in a very long time. Again I know I started talking to her and I never engage someone like that, but talking nonsense out loud during a memorial for the victims of 7/10... I just couldn't. I was disguised by the protests around the world before. And I couldn't believe some people just can't give the jewish people that one day of peace. 

If you had told me couple years ago that my 20s would be filled with the vile rise of antisemitism everywhere, I would have laughed to your face. I had thought we were past this. This incredible medieval way of thinking is just unbelievable.

Overall great memorial. We had both national anthems and number of songs in hebrew by Omer Tal. Local rabbi gave a speech, some celebrities and Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic as well. Israeli exchange student  gave a speech, he lost three friends on 7/10, one of them being Hersh Goldberg Polin.  

I probably forgot a lot of things I wanted to say. Anyway. Keep safe everyone. I honestly adore all of you, Israelis and Jewish people everywhere, for being able to keep up with all of this negativity and hatred. If any other religious/ethnic group faced this everyone would go mental. 

We didn't forget about you here in Prague.

Israel,Israel,"Israel‚Äôs action against Hezbollah was one of the most precise counter-terrorism operations in the history of warfare. We haven‚Äôt seen anything like it. And for whatever reason, I‚Äôve seen people refer to it as an indiscriminate bombing of civilians and terrorism. WHAT?! 

4,000 Hezbollah operatives are injured, 400 in critical condition, and at least 12 have so far been confirmed killed (edit: these numbers have changed with updated info; this argument stands). There is nothing indiscriminate about this situation, but people focus on the singular 10 year old that was killed as a result of her terrorist father letting her hold his pager.  

We‚Äôve all seen videos of the pagers and walkies detonating, which hardly produced enough power to seriously threaten people in the surrounding area. Notice that most of the Hezbollah members themselves didn‚Äôt die (albeit serious injuries) and people only a few feet away from these explosions appear completely unharmed. These weren‚Äôt major explosions happening all across southern Lebanon.

Again, these were pagers handed out SPECIFICALLY to Hezbollah operatives: a designated terrorist organization that for a year now has been lobbing unguided munitions into northern Israel on a daily basis (8,500 since Oct 8th), mostly in civilian areas. They did it again yesterday. Hezbollah has the 8th largest missile stockpile in the world, greater capabilities than some European armies, and are a much larger threat than Hamas. So the idea that this was a group of people just trying to go about their daily lives- and then indiscriminately bombs started detonating- couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. 

Of course there is a massive psychological component to these attacks (so I guess that‚Äôs where people are getting the idea that this is terrorism?). But the only people using these pagers are members/ combatants. These attacks are proportionate and imo 100% justified under international law. Terror attacks are on a civilian population to get a government to behave politically in one way or another. Why do we throw out the definition of these terms?

Ibrahim and another officer reached the fence when they were shot at, and the officer was wounded. Ibrahim fired back and carried the officer to safety. Meanwhile, many terrorists broke through and entered the base. Ibrahim fought them valiantly until his last bullet, killing 17 terrorists before he was killed. He fought with courage and bravery and saved many lives at the base.

He was 39 years old when he died. He left behind a wife, four children, and a remarkable legacy of a brave warrior who was also a symbol of Israeli partnership. Hero of Israel, may his memory be blessed.

Making fun of massacres such as Re‚Äôim. And i started getting more into middle eastern politics and started supporting Israel. It started with me defending Jewish and Israeli people and the State of Israel itself in some arguments and calling my friends stupid and disgusting when they would act antisemitic. They started telling me i was going away from my religion by defending Israel. And more and more slowly i started to become an Israeli supporter. And it has cost me losing almost all of my online friends, who also tried doxxing me for supporting Israel (shoutout to you if you see this)
And they started calling me an disbeliever and blah blah we got into an argument, more arguing, we stopped being friends. etc etc. But i replaced them with people who also support Israel, and they are actually kind to me.

It‚Äôs amazing that she thinks most Israelis are light skinned and blonde and are not brown. 

Obviously, she has never visited Israel. Leaving aside the fact that most Jews in Israel are brown, how is it that a people who were persecuted for not being European and sent to the gas chambers 80 years ago are suddenly considered white?

On a side note, how have they normalized this racism against white people? 
Why do we accept ANY racism against ANY race or skin color? 

This is not about the Palestinians and Israel, this is pure bigotry and lies.

The progressive movement has gone too far. It's the Jews and Israel now, but it won't end there.

The most recent data indicates that Mizrahi Jews represent about 40% to 45% of Israel's total population. This figure includes those of full or partial Mizrahi ancestry. It's important to note that the term 'Mizrahi' broadly encompasses Jews from various regions in the Middle East and North Africa, and the demographics can vary with new surveys and over time.

Israel,Israel,"Here is a picture of me! Due to my mixed heritage, this has caused me to have a light brown skin complexion, big brown eyes, and dark curly hair. (Think of what a Yemenite or an Ethiopian/Eritrean woman looks like) 

To clarify, I am half Israeli, and a lot of my heritage comes from northeast Africa as well. My family is mixed with Christian‚Äôs, Jewish people, and Muslims (I was raised on  the religion of Islam as a child, but im ethnically Jewish due to family ties) and some of those family members live in Israel. 

This leads to A LOT of racial manipulation from the pro Pali people. They tell me how ‚Äúracist‚Äù Israelis are and that as a brown/black woman I shouldn‚Äôt support ‚Äúmy oppressors‚Äù which is ironic considering the fact that a lot of my family FLED TO ISRAEL for freedom and to escape their oppressors. Also, i never understood the whole ‚ÄúIsraelis are racist‚Äù bit. Like well yeah there probably are racist Israelis, cause guess what?! Racism is everywhere! A Chinese can be racist, an American can be racist, an Egyptian can be racist, etc. You‚Äôre never going to find a country that doesn‚Äôt have some stupid racist people. So that whole argument is just pointless. 

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is, a lot of the pro Pali people lack a lot of the basic knowledge about the demographics of Israel. I just always thought it was common knowledge that Israel is one of the most diverse countries in the Middle East. But it could be because of how big and diverse my family is. 

I could go on and on about the other bits of basic knowledge that pro Pali people lack, but I‚Äôm only going to talk about the racial bit because this is something that I have dealt with on a very personal level.

Israel,Israel,"I'm on vacation with my extended family. I'm an agnostic Jew and a Zionist. My neiece, a non Jew going to an elite college, is a big supporter of the Palestinians. Since October 7th, I started wearing an Israel hat along with a Star of David. 

The reason is simple: Israel is facing an existential threat, and I fear it may not survive. This conflict is as much about propaganda as it is about military action. Everyone seems to have their own 'facts,' many of which are blatant falsehoods (on both sides). There are more antisemites and pro-Palestinians than Zionists in the world. Hamas knows it cannot defeat Israel militarily, so it focuses on capturing hearts and minds. They are winning.  I am pushing back.

I wear this hat almost every day to represent Israel and the Jewish people, and to show that we are no different from anyone else. We are good people. This is my way of supporting Israel.

My niece told her mom that the hat is really upsetting her. I was asked to not wear it anylonger on this trip.  I'm in a foreign country, with very few Jews and wearing it gives me the opportunity to demostrate support and project out the goodness of my people.

Update on my post from about a month ago‚Ä¶ check my profile to read. 

I want to transfer. i can‚Äôt stand it anymore. my friends were doxxed, faced anti-israel presentations in class and campus is COVERED in pro palestinian propaganda. 

I have been afraid to go to class all week. They took over a huge part of campus called Voorhees Mall where a lot of lecture halls surround this area and the mall is in the middle. Look at the photos of what they did. It‚Äôs terrifying. 


I‚Äôm involved in Hillel and ICC so I am getting help from them but Rutgers won‚Äôt do ANYTHING. Another person I know had their face plastered all over their dorm building. I can‚Äôt fucking do this anymore. 

I want to speak up and continue to fight for the Jewish community but i‚Äôm so scared something will happen to me. These organizations are insane. 

Here‚Äôs some photos- dm me if you want more. And if anyone has advice pls help me i‚Äôm so scared.  I missed so many of my classes this week.

You may very well know that my country (üáπüá∑) support the t3rr0r1st h*mas, as well as the majority of the population.

But don't let all those threats, antisemitism, BDS, bigotry, holocaust denial etc. deter you. I, as well as a group of enlightened people in the Turkish Republic support Israel and it's people.

And the best part is that I'm not even an atheist/Jew/emigrant (gurbet√ßi). I am Muslim and I live in Turkey, and until my last breath I will support Israel and fight antisemitism everywhere!

My name is Raz Akta, a 23-year-old artist from Israel, deeply connected to the ancient craft of Yemenite silversmithing. Growing up surrounded by art and inspired by my mother, Orit Akta, a globally renowned artist, I discovered my passion for this nearly forgotten tradition during a chance encounter with ancient Yemenite jewelry. Drawn to its history and beauty, I sought out the last master silversmith willing to teach me‚Äîa craft traditionally passed only from father to son. Over a year of study, I immersed myself in the rich heritage of Yemenite Culture, a community with unique customs, rituals, and a way of life distinct from other Jewish traditions. Their lives in Yemen were filled with deep spirituality, artistry, and resilience, shaped by centuries of tradition and culture.

Now, I am dedicated to preserving and sharing this rare art form with the world, ensuring its tradition gets passed down to future generations. Through my journey, I‚Äôve learned not only about silversmithing but also about the remarkable stories of Yemenite Jews, their traditions, and their unique place in Jewish history.

I just came across [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide) and i am still shocked. wikipedia is now in full cooperation with Hamas, The disinformation warriors has set this lie in stone.

Now read [this article about october 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_genocide_in_the_2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel). When it comes to massacring Israelis intentionally, then it's just allegations of genocide: ""Allegations have been made that the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel constituted a genocidal massacre against Israelis."" and ""genocidal rape (alleged).""

If they set the bar this low, where every war equals genocide, then why are all these events not also genocides?:

Israel,Israel,"Sharing an analysis:

With all the noise, all the protests, all the international media, all the mindless anti-semites braying, its hard to see the forest for the trees. And that forest is quite a forest.

Despite our tradgedy, suffering, and humiliation on October 7th, in the wider scope of things, Israel is winning big. Consider our situation on October 6th. We had two massive terrorist armies on our borders, whom if they had attacked together, with Iranian support, could have dealt Israel an existential blow.

Now, one year later Hamas in Gaza is basically non-existent. True, they could survive and slowly build back, but that will be decades, and under a watchful Israeli eye. And true, we don't have the hostages back, but that will in all likelihood be resolved in one way or another.

On the lebanese front, just last month, we were in fear when Nasrallah would announce he was preparing a speech. Now, Hezbollah is gutted and humiliated. Sure, we shouldn't underestimate and they are still very dangerous, but the strategic equations are broken, and Israel is in many ways free from Hezbollah's stranglehold.

And in the West Bank, we have been conducting the most serious operations since the second intifada. True, there's still a lot to do, but we are beginning to regain deterrence there.

And most important, Israeli's are awoken from their slumber, and much more aware of our place in the world, global anti semitism, the Iranian threat, the Jordanian border, and the distant Egyptian threat.

And despite this year which has broken thousands of Israeli families and put tremendous pressure on our economy, and despite the protests, the country is still functioning pretty well. You can travel, go out to restaurants, and go to work.

Quite an accomplishment. If we can sort out our inane internal divisions, this will be a decade of mega prosperity for Israel

My great grandmother was born in Poland in 23rd of July 1929 and lived with her mom grandma and brother at the start of the war she and family were right in the middle of ghetto Warsaw and they had to house other Jewish families so the families had places to live seeing that her grandmother being a former nurse knew that if she didn't do anything her daughter and grandchild would die (my grandmother's brother was sent to her father at the start of the war) so she took a syringe and told my grandma that she would be asleep and then turn yellow and then she and her mom and her half sister would survive after her grandma died her mom sent my grandma to her father, her father seeing her was not happy and for my grandma to survive she was like their maid but getting paranoid he sent her away to other houses and it happened again and again with the other houses after some time she happened to stumble across someone who was rubbing a safe place for Jewish children and she stayed there for the rest of the war but while staying there she was bullied by the other kids for not knowing Jewish enough because she didn't speak Yiddish after the war she did an Alliya and joined the police force in Israel where she found her first husband and was one of the founders iirc  of a village called neveh mivtakh where she lived until the day she died

It is equivalent to Medina for Muslims. Medina holds the grave of Mohammed, while Chevrons holds the graves of the patriarchs Avraham, Yitzhak, Yaakov, and the matriarchs Sarah, Rivka and Leah. How much effort did Abraham make to acquire this grave for Sarah? The Cave of Machpelah is Jewish!

I was deeply shocked by this realization and began to develop a sense of connection to the Jewish people because of it. Tomorrow, I will mourn for the children of the patriarchs. No one should take Chevron from us.

Israel,Israel,"Excerpt - ‚ÄúPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar marks ‚Äúthe beginning of the day after Hamas.‚Äù

‚ÄúHamas will no longer rule Gaza,‚Äù Netanyahu promises in a video statement. ‚ÄúThis is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny.‚Äù

Turning to the hostage families, Netanyahu says this is ‚Äúan important moment‚Äù in the war. ‚ÄúWe will continue with all our strength until the return of all of your loved ones, who are our loved ones.‚Äù

Netanyahu then turns to Gazan civilians: ‚ÄúSinwar ruined your life. He told you he was a lion, but in reality he was hiding in a dark den. And he was killed when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo the Hamas terrorists I say: your leaders are fleeing and they will be eliminated,‚Äù he continues.

He says that anyone holding hostages will be allowed to live if they lay down their weapons and release their captives.

‚ÄúAnd at the same time I say, whoever harms our hostages, his blood will be on his head,‚Äù says Netanyahu. ‚Äù We will come to a reckoning with him.‚Äù

Netanyahu says freeing the hostages brings the end of the war closer.

Addressing the people of the Middle East, Netanyahu says there is ‚Äúa great opportunity to stop the axis of evil and create a different future.‚Äù

Netanyahu says that Sinwar‚Äôs killing makes clear to critics in Israel and abroad why his government insisted on continuing the war. ‚ÄúWhy we insisted, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafah, the fortified stronghold of Hamas where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.‚Äù‚Äù",t2_3ul6og7o,"PM after Sinwar killing: Those holding hostages will be spared if they lay down arms, release them",0.97,919,1729188020.0,1729188020.0,32,lostmason,1g5x4n3

""The northern Israeli town ravaged by a Hezbollah rocket attack Saturday that killed at least 11 people ‚Äî mostly children ‚Äî and injured dozens of others is home to members of the Druze community.

The Druze are an insular Arabic-speaking ethnoreligious minority who originated in Egypt roughly 1,000 years ago as an offshoot of Islam. Its members keep secret the tenets of their faith, which bars converts and frowns upon marrying outside the religion...

Out of the estimated 1 million Druze living in the world today, roughly 152,000 reside in Israel, making up 1.4% of the nation‚Äôs population...

Unlike most Arab communities in the Middle East, however, the Druze are known for their support of the Jewish state and are required to enroll in the Israel Defense Forces when they turn 18.""",t2_3ul6og7o,Who are the Druze?

Israel,Israel,"I tried arguing with some guys at work and on the internet about the current conflict, and shit got heated quickly. What I learned from the ""debates"" was that there is a very significant amount of people, who, no matter the evidence and logic, just hates your fucking guts.

Here are some things I learned from my coworker, and other pro-palis I've had the pleasure of ""debating"":

Zionism isn't supporting a jewish state's right to exist. Not to them. Even though the definition is very easy to find on the web. To these people, zionism is like an evil jewish ideology, where genocide must be carried out against the ancient muslim people of palestine, in order to steal their land and expand the borders of the zionist empire. Or some shit like that. Zionism is also like n_zism to them, basically.

Genocide is when Israel are the cause of casualties, (you bombed all schools, hospitals, etc. in Gaza, and probably for fun) and the casualties are EXTREME compared to literally everything.

H√Øtler was, like, the worst dude in history, but if Iran wiped Israel off the map tomorrow, killing the same percentage of jews as H√Øtler did, they would be down for that. I would expect them to say ""They had it coming"" or something like that, if Israel got nuked.

Theodor Hertzl, who is that?

Israel is apparently NOT a jewish state. It is a zionist state that has no right to exist and must be destroyed. How that is supposed to happen without millions getting killed, they don't know (or care, most likely).

All the wars that Israel has ever been involved in are its own fault. Zionists must be fought and dealt with at all costs.

They do not know history, and they are not willing to learn about it. There is no getting through to these people, they have chosen their ""football team"" and they will back them up no matter what. Their opponents (Israel) are filthy animals and must be defeated.

Golda Meir was right about the world hating jews who fight back. And a lot of other things. You know, for the jews to be G_d's chosen people, he's been giving you guys heaps of shit to deal with throughout history for some reason. Anyway, please stay alive and remember to live well.

I can not even begin to imagine any other reason for this attitude toward Israel than deep-seated antisemitism, which is exactly why Israel needs to exist in the first place.

No country in the world would have put up with 11 months of Hezbollah rockets and infiltrations, only to be criticized when they fight back. It doesn't matter how targeted and smart (beep beep) your attacks are, you always get demonized.

When people seem offended by Israel attacking terrorists, know that the quiet majority in the West are really thrown back, and pushed away from the anti-Israel narrative. Since the 7th of October, the Pro Palestinian and anti Israel take has clearly become a very stupid narrative.

Israel,Israel,"While it may seem like a big part of the world has turned against Israel, you has also gained supporters. I am one of them. One of the many #6 voters in Eurovision. And I think my story isn't uncommon.



I'm a Danish guy. I am not a jew, not religious and have no ties to Israel. Before Gaza's attack, I couldn't tell the political difference between West Bank and Gaza. I honestly didn't really care about the conflict. Not because I deemed it unimportant, but in the same way you probably don't care about historic wars in Sub Saharan Africa. I was a lazy both-sider without strong conviction.



When 7th October happened, I was shocked by the footage of the young woman being pulled by her hair (is there any news on her? I think she might still be a hostage?). In the days after, I thought to my self, that people would surely declare overwhelming support to Israel after the true horrors of Gaza's attack was made clear.



Of course I was naive and ignorant. At the time I was using BBC for world news. I quickly noticed something was off, before Israel had even retaliated. The language they used was disturbing and like they were commenting on a completely different event.



After Israel had started retaliating, I still felt Israel was the more moral party and that they tried to protect the civilians. But I was unsure, because I simply didn't have enough knowledge, and the narratives from news and social media was so conflicting.



It all culminated with the hospital explosion. Where 500 people were allegedly downed by Israel. New York Times, BBC and others of what I thought as the most trust-worthy medias reported it as such. I thought to myself, that this doesn't seem like something Israel would do with my limited knowledge. But if it was true, I would stop being pro-israel. Of course we all know the story. This incident alone shows how Hamas Agencies are lying with their death numbers. Still most of the big medias continue to mouth piece Hamas. They are not doing the same with Russian statements or at least to a much lesser extent. Their integrity is lost.



Anyway I of course changed how I consume media afterwards. I started consuming Times of Israel. I especially like The Daily Briefing podcast, and they are not afraid to criticise Israels actions when warranted. As am I. I started reading The Free Press and Weekendavisen (Danish equivalent, roughly speaking). I believe quality journalism struggle to exist outside subscription-based medias like these, even though they are not without bias. It actually brings me joy that MSM is dying. It is well deserved, and we can do so much better.



Since then I had no more doubts about supporting Israel in-large. Israel is like that tough but good at heart street kid. Put into horrible situations but still trying to do the right thing. It is not fair to compare its actions to an upper class kid like Switzerland or Netherlands, surrounded by friends. You have no choice but to protect your family from fanatic attackers. I really hope you go all the way and take out Iran's nuclear capabilities. World peace might be in your hands.



Know that people like me will punish our respective governments, if they act out against Israel. That is why so many European politicians did double-speak about Netanyahu's arrest order. You have something we don't. A strong sense of unity. Honestly I think that is a big reason, why you are the only western country with a high fertility rate. Even among non-religious Israelis.

Israel,Israel,"The WCK is the agency that was one of the first to respond to Oct 7 and sent humanitarian workers to Israel's south to feed and care for our refugees. We know the UN ignored us and refused to condemn. But the WCK was there for us in our time of need and the founder called out Hamas by name on his social media and defended Israel. 

[https://wck.org/news/wck-response-middle-east](https://wck.org/news/wck-response-middle-east) 

In more recent months, Israle's been working to sidestep UNWRA and other UN agencies and the WCK was a keystone of that. They've been coordinating with Israel for the last month now (as I've been following on COGAT's new humanitarian aid website) to bring convoys to the dangerous areas of the North and flood the ports.

Now, not only have we stabbed a good friend in the back, and damaged a relationship, we also potentially cut off our main future partner to replace UNWRA. We don't have a backup for the WCK.

Beyond the domestic concerns, I mean WCK really does good work globally and the workers who were killed had experience saving lives in half a dozen coutnries. It's a real blow to Israel and humanity.

I hope, if this was a strike done knowingly, knowing that the convoy was WCK, that that drone operator or team gets severely discliplined, and I pray we can rebuild the trust and relationship with this organization.

I don't really care waht the rest of the world has to say about this. The fact that Israel is transparent about mistakes should make us more trustworthy, but instead it becomes cannon fodders for the people who think that we are carrying out ""genocide"" while 130 of our citizens are still languishing in tunnels, mistreated, no communication, dying.... I don't care what the antisemites online have to say or even waht the hypocritical Western governments try to tell us. But I care about the WCK, and I'm angry at the people in the army, whether low ranking or high ranking, who allowed this to happen. It's a serious tragedy, and a logistical snafu.

Israel,Israel,"I'm going to preface this story by saying prior to talking with this person, I was under the assumption that Gazans hated Israelis and, more broadly, Jews. The images of Gazans celebrating in the street upon the return of Hamas members on October 7th will forever be ingrained in my memory, as well as the polls that we are all familiar with, which illustrate majority support of Hamas in Gaza. Armed with these images, I was angry and hateful toward those on the other side; I saw no hope for future peace between our people until one fateful day when I received a message. 

# How We Met. 

I often argue with woke pro-palies in Instagram comment sections despite it being completely pointless, which I assume is where this person found my account. I noticed a message in my DM requesting me to donate to a GoFundMe. I thought this person was either a bot or a scammer, so I just replied, ""Go ask Hamas to surrender,"" and their response shocked me; they told me, ""Hamas does not listen to the people and only does what it wants."" Given that I was under the impression that Gazans supported Hamas, this was very confusing. In order to see if she was telling the truth, I searched through her Instagram and cross-referenced things which would tell me if she was really from Gaza. Eventually, everything checked out; she was real and lived in Deir al Balah in central Gaza. 

I told her I was Israeli, and she said I was not the first Israeli friend she had made, telling me about another girl she had talked to over the course of the war. Since then we have spoken almost every day, talking about various topics from photography, family, food and travel. I asked her about her life in Gaza and her future ambitions, including, most importantly, the ambition of peace; we even said how one day we hope to have a coffee in Tel Aviv together and share food and stories. 

# What She Told Me About Hamas. 

What would shock most people is she completely blames Hamas for the outbreak of the war. Early in our conversation, she spoke about her desire for Hamas to leave Gaza, blaming them for ""destroying their lives, and above all, they do not want to surrender."" Over time, we have repeatedly talked about the war, and it was surprising to me that she shared the same fears that many of us do. Mainly, she knew that if the war stopped, Hamas would remain in power. *However, I wanted to add that for her and the people of Gaza, this question is a bigger mental battle: Do you continue the war and potentially see more family and friends die, or do you think the war should carry on to finally get Hamas out of power?* 

https://preview.redd.it/y0r2lk8mh1vc1.jpg?width=3350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f15f3a1a99aa7a02e7da4e96d9643ae0094da955

As we continued to speak, she told me more about how the majority of people Hated Hamas even prior to the war, such as in 2020 when Hamas suppressed protests against corruption and living conditions. She told me a personal story about her father, who Had previously worked for Fatah prior to the 2007 takeover. In response to one of the demonstrations against Hamas, Hamas members broke into her family home, looking for her father. Despite not having any connection to the protests, the Hamas members demanded she and her brother tell them where their father was; neither of them knew, so Hamas violently beat the pair and also pointed guns at her mother while threatening them. 

Another interesting point she makes is Hamas' use of media, which they use to paint themselves in a positive light to the outside world. According to her, while the majority of Gazans despise Hamas, those outside are fed misinformation. She even talks about having arguments with her mother's family in Jordan because of how Hamas paints themselves in the media, in opposition to what She tells them is really going on.

At one point, I asked about the level of food insecurity, given the ongoing claims of famine. While she did say that food is harder to come by in the North, given that distribution is difficult, she says that there is enough food coming into central Gaza. However, the central problem behind the food problem is Hamas' consistent exploitation of prices. She told me that food which is marked as 'not for sale.' is consistently being sold at high prices. I asked her if this was because the vendors were trying to make money or because of Hamas; she answered that Hamas Hordes the aid and then sells it for high prices to vendors, which results in higher processes for consumers.

Lastly, I wanted to mention the topic of leaving Gaza. While many have been able to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing, these have only been Gaza's wealthy and elite. She told me that since the outbreak of the war, the main transport company, named 'Hala', have increased their prices sevenfold, from $1,000 per person to $7,000 per person. This is solely for the reason of exploitation. I have found [articles](https://news.sky.com/video/the-firm-charging-gazans-to-flee-13084067) which have stated the company has made $1m in revenue per day at the time of writing just from people trying to leave. 

# What Did I Want To Get From Writing This? 

After hearing her story, I found an immense sense of comfort in knowing that my understanding of the relationship between Gazans and Hamas was wrong. Even more importantly, talking to her over the course of the war has given me a renewed sense of hope for peace. I found inspiration in the fact that she had no contempt for Israel despite having lost family members and her home being bombed. If she could overcome the sadness from these incidents and see the bigger picture, then I should be able to do the same with my resentment. 

Therefore, I hope in light of this information, those who read this will be able to imagine themselves one day having a coffee with someone on the other side of the fence, no matter how absurd the thought seems now. 

# Final Notes.

This girl and her family are currently trying to raise money to get out of Gaza. While I am not going to openly solicit people for donations, if anyone wants to donate, no matter how small it is, please feel free to message me, and I will link their GoFundMe. (I hope this doesn't go against the rules of the sub.)

Also, while this is a very rough draft, I would be very interested in trying to get her story published in any newsletter or website, either written by myself or someone else and after a more in-depth interview of the girl. I believe getting this story out there will at least restore the hope that peace is possible. If you know anyone who could help, I would greatly appreciate that. 

As for my own opinions of the war, I think it should continue, including an invasion of Rafah. I think there is no point in causing this much destruction and not finishing the job. Leaving Hamas in power only sows the seeds for a future conflict. However, after having this conversation, I have a heightened sense of sympathy towards the people of Gaza.

Israel,Israel,"For context, I work at a discount retail store as a cashier. 

A woman came up to my register to buy a suitcase, although her eyes were straying to our snack shelves (they get everyone). She was pale-ish with long black hair.

I asked her if she wanted a bag---she declined by joking that she wanted to save the turtles. I laughed politely, and we spoke about it a little more. She near verbatim lamented that companies ""gaslight"" ordinary people when they're the ones responsible for a lot of pollution.

By then, she'd already picked out a snack, a bag of vegan gum. She was particularly excited about that because she was vegan, and that the gum also did not have a particular ingredient that causes indigestion. She clearly knew what she was talking about. 

I told her I admired vegans because I have too little restraint to swear off meat. She explained that she grew up on a farm. ""That'll do it,"" I sympathized, then asked if her farm was in the rural part of my state.

""No,"" she said, ""I grew up on a farm somewhere far away in the Middle East.""

Immediately, that struck me as odd. Not because I thought she was of European origin at first, although I did do a quick once-over lol. I found it odd because most people from the Middle East don't self-describe that way, they'll just say their country. I thought: well, who wouldn't want to say their country? That's when I got the feeling she might be Israeli.

We talked some more. She offered me some of the gum she just bought, and it was really good. She explained she was buying a suitcase for travel, and that her coworkers were still shopping in the store. 

She left and came back with her coworkers. Two gentleman: one with an awesome hat and a ginger beard, and the other a pretty nondescript looking guy. They were speaking a language I was sure wasn't Arabic. When they came to check out, they were equally as friendly as the woman. And as a side note---if any of them gendered me at all, they gendered me as male. This is significant because I'm trans, and while I pass pretty well, I pass less at work because I don't bind there.

Just before the last guy (ginger) finished paying, I drummed up the courage to ask what language they were speaking. ""Hebrew,"" he told me with an incredibly kind smile, ""we're from Israel."" I told him that was very cool and handed him his bag, wishing him a good day. They left. 

This might seem like a pretty benign interaction, and well, it is. But that was the first time I met anyone from Israel. And they were so unlike anything I'd been told to believe about Jewish Israelis from the pro-Palestinian circles I used to be in, like Israelis being backwards racists or religious fundamentalist colonizers. Instead they were kind, well-educated and (as far as I could tell) liberal. 

Not inviting anyone to look through my post/comment history, but you can see me back in 2023 defending ""from the river to the sea"" (yikes). Needless to say it took a lot of thinking, looking at resources, and questioning things to get to this point. And this interaction had me wondering what I would've thought of those same three people back then- if I would've thought they were disgusting, complicit to genocide.

But now? All I feel is disheartened that this woman, in all likelihood, felt the need to hide being an Israeli. I feel incredibly angry with my peers and fellow progressives, who have all but abandoned the Jewish people. I've watched ""antizionism is not antisemitism"" turn into ""isn't it weird we can criticize Christians but not Jews?"" turn into ""maybe if everyone in the world hates Jews, there's a reason for it."" I feel dizzy at the amount of misinformation there is in the Pro-Palestinian movement, even when it comes to basic facts about the Jewish or Palestinian people (yes Jewish is an ethnicity, no Palestinians are not semitic). Once you see how much antisemitism proliferates our daily lives, its impossible to stop seeing. And I can tell you right now that there is no gentile antizionist that is not an antisemite, because any person who gives a singular shit about antisemitism would see how crucial it is to have a Jewish state. 

Obviously, Israel and her actions aren't perfect. But they don't have to be for an indigenous people to ""deserve"" self-determination in their ancestral lands. I know it seems like the youth, the left, or whomever has completely abandoned Israel, but hey, I'm here. So from a trans leftist college-goer:

It is frequently stated that 70% of the casualties in the Israel-Hamas are women and children, however according to the most recent numbers by the OCHA, this claim is mathematically impossible.

# Total killed

=34,904

# Numbers killed if 70% of casualties are women and children

=24,433 (34,904\*0.7)

# Number of identified women and children killed

=12,756 (4,959 + 7,797)

# Number of unidentified women and children who would need to be killed to make up 70% of the casualties.

=11,677 (24,433 ‚Äì 12,756)

# Total number of unidentified

Israel killed about 45,000 people in 1 year. Presumably close to 20,000 of them active combatants.

Hamas killed 1200 people in about 5-6 hours. If Israel did not do anything it's not like they would have stopped. Hamas' (and Hezbollah's) stated goal is to kill everyone in Israel. 

If Hamas was able to run amock without any Israeli defense, in 10 days they would have killed over 40,000 people. And as we know, over 2/3 civilians (and the other third consistent of many off duty soldiers).

Israel,Israel,"I‚Äôll try to make it short (and skip details to not dox myself, also why I‚Äôm using my alt). During Oct 7 I was on base when we got called to the south (I wasn‚Äôt very near, but still not far either), and spent all day between fighting the terrorists and evacuating civilians. I was on different kibbutzim during the day, and at night I got to one of the most affected ones, in which, during a mission to rescue civilians from their houses, terrorists ambushed us, and as a result I got shot. 

The thing is while a lot of people are calling me  a ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù from that horrendous day, I‚Äôm not able to think about myself like that (I get their pov though). Firstly because I‚Äôve heard different stories from the people that either lived in the kibbutzim or where in Nova, and they‚Äôre truly testimonies from people that survived. Which leads me to my second point, which is that I got shot while on service, which is the only reason I was there.

I know this may not be the best place to talk about it, but with the year coming up (which is almost the same time that I‚Äôve started asking myself that question), and feeling that I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk about this with, this may have been a good place to start opening my struggles from that day.

Hi Reddit! 

Please see the attached picture. This was gifted to my grandfather who served in the Hagana. Sadly, he died in 2013 at the age of 94 and as a young adult I still have so many unanswered questions I would love to ask him. He was an exemplary role model who was both caring and stubborn. His story is quite unbelievable and I wish I could learn more about his journey. 

Feel free to ask me any questions and I will do my best to answer or redirect to family members who may know more!

October 7 was not the only massacre by Arabs against Jews.  The list of pogroms is long For example:

1920 Irbid massacres

1921 Jaffa Massacres

1929: Jerusalem Massacres

1929 Hebron Massacres

1929 Safed Massacres

1932 Jaffa Massacres

1936 Jaffa Massacres

1936 Nazareth and Beit Shean

1936 Balfouriya

1936 Haifa

1938 Tiberias Massacre

and many many more.  That list doesn't even get us to the olympics, the plane bombings, the random cafe, bus, and synagogue bombings by Palestinians against Israeli citizens.  
Violence begets violence.  Try another way.
The entire Palestinian identity is wrapped up in a myth about a Nabka when in reality it is a history of violence against Jews.  It is time to relinquish hate and help the people of Palestine live.

Arabs tried to genocide Jews and in 1948 after the Jews agreed on the partition plan and Arabs didn't. They opened a war on us trying to kill the jews , and LOST.

Israel,Israel,"I'm an American currently living in Western Europe. I'm not Jewish, and to be honest, I didn't think much about Israel until the October 7th attacks and the outbreak of war in Gaza. Since then, I've been seeking more information about this conflict and have come to realize how radical and baseless much of the pro-Pali rhetoric is. I'm not saying that Israel is 100% blameless (I know there is some kind of shady stuff going on in the West Bank right now, for example) but to me, it's clear that in this conflict, Israel is in the right overall. Israel left Gaza in 2005; that, combined with the millions of dollars of humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza should have given Palestine ample opportunity to build itself into at least a semi-functioning society that doesn't just foment terrorism. But it seems that that opportunity was squandered, and instead Hamas came to power. Hamas attacked, murdered, and raped innocent Israelis in the October 7th attack. Hamas wants an end to both Israel and the Jewish people. Israel has the right to retaliate and try to eliminate this terrorist group. To say otherwise is absurd. And to me, the idea of a one-state solution is equally absurd. How is it even remotely plausible that Israel can absorb millions of Palestinian Arabs, the majority of whom openly support and elected an anti-Israel terror group?

The right of Jews to live in peace in their ancestral land (from which they were exiled thousands of years ago and have reclaimed) without constant threat of attack from jihadists should be obvious and not up for debate. Yet Israel is constantly maligned and accused of genocide, a word that people throw around like it means nothing, cheapening actual instances of genocide, like the Holocaust.

I read the news from mainstream American news outlets like NBC, which honestly isn't too egregious and at least refers to Hamas as a terrorist organization. But I also read news out of Sweden, as my partner is Swedish and I've learned the language since we plan to move there in the future. Their coverage quite frankly appalls me. SVT, the taxpayer-funded Swedish national public television network, publishes nothing but extremely biased, pro-Palestinian garbage. Just today I read an article detailing Israel's killings of key terrorist leaders; however, the article contained precisely zero mentions of the fact that these are terrorist leaders, instead using terms like ""Hamas politiska ledare"" (Hamas political leader). They also prominently featured an article just a couple of days ago decrying that over 40 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack (a number that I think hasn't even been verified), while when Israelis were killed by Jordanians in a terror attack, they meagerly suggested ""Israel says it was a terror attack.""

I'm sick of this. I am the type of person who really hates injustice, and it makes me sick that the West is being sold a bill of pro-Hamas goods and people take this information at face value, forming skewed and anti-semitic views about Israel and the Jewish people. I worry that this knee-jerk leftism in which Arabs are always innocent victims is only going to become more prevalent in the coming years.

That's all. That's my opinion. I guess I just needed a place to vent about this because I feel like I don't have an outlet in the ""real"" world.",t2_d7kphx8h,I'm quite simply fed up with the anti-Israel slander,0.9,825,1726214118.0,1726214118.0,130,Suspicious-Fuel-4307,1ffpaxv

My great grandmother who came her as a Holocaust survivor and refugee would be very saddened by what Montreal has become. This has nothing to do with Israel, it is simply an excuse for the antisemites to show their true feelings. Stop blaming innocent Jews for actions of the Israeli government that you dislike. If they had legitimate arguments they wouldn‚Äôt need to rely on these tactics and intimidation. They know deep down they have lost the debate and most of the world still believes in Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself (in accordance with international law) after the most brutal terrorist attack since the Holocaust. Free Palestinians from Hamas. 

Democracy has room for genuine critiques of any group or government but it cannot survive if authoritarian groups like these protesters are permitted to silence the opposition. These are not the actions of activists who genuinely care about the human rights of others, this is the behaviour of petulant children who wish to express their rage and antisemitism.

This is the story about Karin. She went to the Nova party with her friends and didn't give up even though she was recovering from a broken leg. At 08:42, Karin called her mother and said, ""Mom, we're being shot at, I'm scared to death. If something happens to me, I love you. We're being shot at with live fire,"" and she hung up. But Karin couldn't run. She reached the designated ambulance parked in Nova, it was supposed to be a safe place, but the terrorists fired an RPG into it as soon as they discovered people inside. They were all burned alive. 137 days after that morning a package arrived at her house, inside, what was left of a watch she wore on her hand. This is a story about a whole life and dreams that have come true. A story about absolute evil versus pure good. This is the story of the angelic Karin who did not return from the nova. She is smiling in heaven now. Her spirit is with us forever.

Transcript of the excerpt: 

>**When it comes to the issue of the hostage talks, one of the things that I have found somewhat absent from the coverage is that what we are talking about in the first phase is women, elderly, and wounded civilians.  Those who would like to see a ceasefire in Gaza ‚Äî a ceasefire is on the table today for six weeks to be built on into something more enduring if Hamas would simply release women, wounded, and elderly**. 

>**And the fact that they will not do so says a lot to me about Hamas‚Äôs regard for innocent Palestinian civilians ‚Äî the fact that they are holding on to those folks and refusing to release them and refusing to step up and say that we could get this ceasefire in place, which not only would bring calm to the fighting but also would create an enormous opportunity to flow humanitarian assistance in in much greater quantities**.  Because a significant part of the problem on the humanitarian assistance front, as you know, has not just been getting trucks into Gaza but getting trucks around Gaza because it is difficult to move them in light of all of the ‚Äî in light of all of the fighting.

>Now, we‚Äôve also encouraged Israel to stay at the table, stay engaged, because we believe that there still is scope for this deal to get done.

I see you in the news, holding an Israeli flag while being surrounded by a human chain made of thousands of less than savory characters and am in awe of your strength.

Israel,Israel,"Shalom everyone! 

After reading a couple of threads, and speaking to Jewish friends I‚Äôve come to learn that Israel is NOT wrong and is doing what it has to do!  It‚Äôs time the Arab Muslim world accepted Israel and started learning from them as well! Before I get into it, I would like to say even the Quran mentions the 12 tribes of ISRAEL (albeit only Joseph is mentioned in detail but that‚Äôs a topic for another day),  and quote ‚ÄúO Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others‚Äù is a verse as well.

Ok now that we‚Äôve highlighted that Israel is valid and has every right to exist, let‚Äôs talk about some Arab countries treatment of Jews. First up, Syria. Yup, I‚Äôm a Syrian Muslim and I‚Äôve recently been interested in learning about the Jews of Syria.  They obviously were treated like crap which forced them to leave their homes and migrate to Israel which was a safe haven for them. That‚Äôs crazy like how do some Arab Syrians just shrug that off??  As of 2022, there are only FOUR Jews left in Syria ‚Ä¶.4?!!!  It saddens me that these people left, but their impact can still be seen in Aleppo for example. Syria is in shambles because of that warmonger Bashar and his Iranian allies (gross) and it‚Äôs now a sh*thole for real. How can Syrians who have no food water or electricity criticize a country that offers these resources to its people in abundance? Also fyi a lot of Palestinians joined Bashar‚Äôs ranks and killed innocent Syrian civilians, yeah that didn‚Äôt fly with me! Plus many Palestinians are Bashar supporters, bye Felicia! 

Also, Syrians wish to live in Golan heights. The ones that do live there are  safe, happy and I believe hold Israeli citizenship?! (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).

Sorry about the rant, just wanted to say that some Arabs support Israel and it‚Äôs time others do the same. 

Edit: I think it‚Äôs time Arab Muslims accepted Israel and respected them because they ain‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon. Plus I firmly believe the word ‚ÄúJew‚Äù needs to be normalized and accepted in all Muslim communities. Some see the term as an insult which is anti semitic and we all know that‚Äôs been on the rise.

Israel,Israel,"If 90% of Palestinians trust and support Hamas, there is no shame to say that most pro-Palestinians are pro-Hamas, which in my recent experience is not wrong.

I live in Britain, and at my place of work, I have an outspoken, zealous Muslim youngster, who've I had the misfortune of sitting down and engaging in conversation with.

Now, I don't have anything against Muslims, as long as they keep their religion and ""truth"" to themselves. I just don't respect them because of how my heritage suffered because of the Ottomans.

The discussion was about war and how my home country (Romania) could be in danger due to the war in Ukraine, which I've expressed my disdain for, quoting my support for the Ukrainians.

He proceeded to tell me about how Ukraine doesn't even compare to Palestine, about how kids are getting blown to pieces, about how thr IDF murders women, and how everything started in 1947 with the Nakba.

I didn't express my support for Israel due to personal safety concerns, as he seemed quite vehement when talking about Zionists, where he said they kicked out all the Palestinians in 1947, massacred them, and stole their land.

I told him I am impartial to this, and that there are people suffering on both sides. I couldn't manage to finish a sentence without him interrupting me, and when stating fact, he expressed his ignorance.

A couple of other things he said:

""I don't hate Jews, I hate Zionists. Most Zionists aren't even real Jews. Even the religious Jews call them 'kafirs'."" - likely quoting the Naturei Karta

""I'd fight for them. (The Palestinians)""

""I've picked a side mate, because I know it's the truth. It's even in the Quran.""

And then the discussion deviated towards religion, where he criticized Christianity (my religious background), saying the trinity is stupid and doesn't work.

I feel really uncomfortable working with this dude. I don't know what to do. I can't even be true to myself and my beliefs because he'd probably kill me.

Israel,Israel,"**The subreddit has re-opened. Welcome back!** And feel free to post as usual.

I hope that those of us in pain found some meaning and restoration through reflection yesterday.

For those of us still confused about why the sub was shut down:

On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a genocidal terrorist attack that included the murder of more than 1200 people and the taking of more than 250 hostages. October 7 was the most violent attack targeting Jews since the Holocaust, and included torture as well as the weaponization of sexual violence.

**In remembrance of the victims of 10/7‚Äìand the many hostages who still remain in Gaza‚Äîwe shut the sub down for October 7, 2024, the one year anniversary of this tragedy.**

After 10/7 Israel initiated a war against Hamas and the other terrorist groups that the IRGC of Iran has fueled to destroy the Jewish state. Over the year since we have witnessed the downfall of Hamas‚Äôs and Hezbollah‚Äôs leaders.

**On this day we thus also remember the soldiers who have served in the IDF and sacrificed their lives** to protect not only Israel and its inhabitants (including both the Jewish people, and its diverse minorities, such as the Druze-Israelis) but also the free world.

On October 7, *2024*, we are not victims because we have a state and an army that has protected us, that enforces Israeli sovereignty and defends our right to self determination; **we are not victims today, in short, because we are Zionists**.

*A note on the subreddit and the moderators' experience:*

In the immediate aftermath of 10/7 this subreddit received so much harassment in the form of antisemitism and comments from malicious actors who justified and gleefully celebrated the atrocities of 10/7--or who paradoxically denied it--that it was forced to go private for a prolonged period.

Quoting one of my co-moderators: ""There was an immense flood of abuse and we were also in shock and incapable of doing our job as mods...I don't think any of us had the time or the mental capacity to sift through the abuse and fake news - we were ourselves trying to understand what was going on, missing loved ones, going to funerals, running to bomb shelters...""

To a large degree the increased harassment has not abated. Disturbingly it is during times when Israel is itself the *recipient* of violence--such as during the IRGC missile and drone attacks of 4/13 and recently on 10/1--that the harassment *spikes* astronomically.

This underscores the fundamental nature of antisemitic harassment as a form of hate.

Israel,Israel,"I posted this as a comment on another post that was recommended to me in another subreddit, but I have seen similar comments here about Noa's captivity.

I'm all too aware of the pro-Palistinian side spreading misinformation and don't want us going down the same path so I'm just putting this out as clarification - Noa was not held by the journalist Abdallah, however, the other 3 Hostages - Almog, Shlomi and Andrey - were held by Abdallah and his family.

According to ynet there was initially false reporting that Noa was found in the home of an Al Jazeera journalist. In fact, in the home of Abdallah the IDF found Abdallah, his wife, his sister and his father (who is a doctor) along with Almog, Shlomi and Andrey. Abdallah, his wife and his father were all killed by the IDF and his sister was shot and wounded during the recuse of the 3 hostages. \[[source](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/rj4lqe7sc)\]

I've seen a few pro-Pal accounts attempt to make out the IDF are awful scum of the earth for murdering a journalist and a doctor but when you're holding hostages for a terrorist organisations I couldn't care less what your official profession is - if you are holding hostages you're also a terrorist and I'm not going to spend one damn minute being sad over your death. You had it coming as far as I'm concerned.

The article from ynet says that Noa was held in an apartment of a neighbouring building at the time the IDF recused her. By¬†[Noa's own testimony the family were a wealthy family and using her as a slave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dchqva/new_testimony_from_noa_argamani/)¬†and she was also moved around at points but was always held in homes, not tunnels \[[Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/argamani-learned-arabic-from-her-captors-who-gave-her-food-when-she-asked-reluctantly-let-her-shower/)\].

This is 2 ""civilian"" families in a ""refugee camp"" that were holding hostages. The term ""civilian"" certainly feels like it's lost a lot of meaning with Hamas and the anti-Israel crowd throwing it around so freely.

Edit: I posted in English because Israeli's are generally very good at English and I know there's a lot of non-Israeli's here and I assume most of them don't know Hebrew (please correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption of the user base) so I always post in English.

Israel,Israel,"Hi everyone. I have been reading the news weekly about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for over a decade, and I would say that I'm aware and have watched videos of almost every major incident that happened since 2010. For years, I have seen so much misinformation, blood-libel and lies being spewed all over the internet, and have debated with hundreds of people over this hoping they could see the truth. (and in case any trolls are wondering, no I don't receive any money from the Israeli government, JIDF or Mossad. Nobody has even offered to recruit me or donate money to me)

Despite dealing with countless amounts of propaganda and lies for years, yesterday was the first time in my life that I actually cried. For the last few months, it has always been the same few Muslims and progressive queer activists posting on IG about Palestine, and I kept telling myself that regular people don't give a shit. However in the last 2 days, friends and acquaintances who have never posted a single political thing in their life have started posting propaganda and half truths about Rafah.

For reference, I live in Singapore which has 75% Chinese, 14% Malay and 9% Indians. Although Malays have always been strongly pro-Palestinian for as long as I can remember, the general attitude of Singaporeans has always been positive towards Israel, especially among the older generation who are grateful towards Israel for being the only country to offer us military aid in the 1960s, and because we also have a significant Christian population.

The people who posted these were ""regular working adults"". Ex-classmates I haven't seen in a decade. Ex-colleagues that I haven't seen in 5 years. People that I hooked up with in a club 10 years ago. People that I met through online games. Relatives. Ex-partners of my friends. Friends of my partners. People that I exercise in the gym with.

Yet here they are posting a conflict they know nothing about. Reposting propaganda full of half truths and many lies. Posting cropped out of context videos. Posting information that has not been verified. Taking videos from other countries and claiming how Israel is literally the most evil nation on earth. It doesn't stop there. I've even seen stories from acquaintances finally re-posting stories saying the quiet part out loud.

> - ""The Zionist entity cannot exist & should be dismantled by any means necessary""
> - ""It's not Netanyahu, the Zionist government or the ""bad settlers"" - it's all of it. Inshallah, may all these empires be swiftly destroyed""
> - The question is: do you believe ""Israel"" should exist?
> - You have to acknowledge that ""Israel"" must be abolished

People are now so far brainwashed by their propaganda that they've managed to switch in just a few months from yelling ""ceasefire""/""innocent civilians"" to justifying how the right thing to do is to destroy an entire nation of 9 million people.

None of them are Russian or Iranian bots. None of them are unemployed students with too much free time living on their parents money. None of them are paid protestors. None of them have any history of antisemitism (as Jews are uncommon in South-East Asia). These are all real people that I've known for years. Many of them identify as progressive, liberals, LGBTs, feminists. Others are models, doctors, teachers, mothers. Majority of them are well educated and very much what I would consider ""regular working people"".

---

It's time to stop pretending that these are just propaganda bots. I'm telling you, it's not. It's time to stop pretending that the silent majority don't care or support Israel. Many of the silent people spoke up recently in support of Palestine. It's time to stop pretending that everything remains fine as long as US polls show majority support Israel. They too can be influenced over time with propaganda, or forced to keep silent. Antisemitism is on the rise across the globe even in places where it never existed. Meanwhile support for Israel is deafening. I have seen 0 posts from anyone in the last 8 months even saying that hostages should be released.

Guy is an innocent, unarmed citizen that Hamas has been holding for over two months. Every request from the Red Cross to check his condition was met with refusal. Guy was later recorded in the captivity of Hamas with other abductees who were at the festival.  Guy could be any of your children, please don't be silent.

Israel is the only functioning democracy where every religion can peacefully coexist, while thriving in a hostile environment. Most pro Palestine supporters never realize that the Jews have nowhere else to go, Europe is already anti-semitic as is and the Arab countries would literally massacre them all. Yemen has no hope of having better relations with Israel the majority of the country if not all want the destruction of Israel. I‚Äôm not sure if there are other people like me, but every time I voice my opinions I get called a self hating Arab or just pushed to the side because ‚Äúthere is no way a Yemeni can support Israel‚Äù.

Israel,Israel,"As a pro-Israel trans woman who's part of their local Jewish community I find the wider queer community's response to the Israel Hamas war to be absolutely disgusting. Like H@mas throws queer people and even it's own queer members off of buildings, and the West Bank isn't much better. Like all I can say is I dare you to find me one Muslim country that wouldn't deny me care as a gay trans woman, at best I would be denied care, at worst physically abused and killed. The H@masniks in the queer community are no better than white Christian nationalists, because they're all fascistic Jew haters. I really don't understand why the non-Jewish queer community isn't vocally pro-Israel. 


Israel is the only country in the Middle East that supports queer rights, gender affirming care is provided by basic universal insurance, and Israel is fighting a war against a horrible group of people, though even calling them ""people"" is a stretch, since they're human animals, but that feels like an insult to animals, who don't actively hate Jews. They're monsters who want to kill every queer person and Jew on the planet. And the queer community has the gall to say ""stop the war"" before H@mas has been eliminated, basically letting H@mas win, and that's completely unacceptable. It's like saying the Allies should stop fighting Germany during WWII because the German people suffered too many casualties. The Gazan people voted for H@mas, now they get to deal with the consequences. Look at how many Palestinians deny or downplay the atrocities of October 7th. How support for H@mas apparently went up shortly after H@mas launched it's attack. 


And Israel didn't start the war, those monsters did by causing the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Shoah, but everyone blames Israel for causing a gEnOcIde. It's very frustrating, Israel are the good guys, undoubtedly, Tel Aviv has the biggest pride parade every year in all of Asia, and Asia is enormous. And also I can't stand when Jews are called white, with maybe myself as an exception since I'm ethnically Irish but religiously Jewish. The H@masniks like to say that Jews are ""white colonizers"", but were the Jews white when H*tler blamed them for all of Germany's problems, no they were not. You could ask every white supremacist in America and the EU if Jews are white and they would say no, because they fucking hate Jews just like how they hate queers, just think back to Charlottesville when white supremacists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"", you think those guys see Jews as white, do you think those guys like Jews? I went to a Tim Walz rally in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania where I live and there were some Muslim looking people protesting because of the war in Gaza, trying to disrupt the rally, everyone started chanting ""USA"" over and over and it was beautiful, as a way to drown out the few H@masniks that were there. I cheered ""Go Israel, go"". Keep fighting Israel, you're on the right side of history, keep fighting evil for yourselves, for the wider Jewish community and for queer rights, even if it will take a long time for the wider queer community to come to appreciate Israel, if they ever do, since unfortunately the chickens for KFC sentiment is very strong in the queer community. 


If queer H@masniks support Palestine so much why don't they move there and try to live openly as a queer person, and they will soon find they'll either be denied gender affirming care or even killed. All I can say is sorry but not sorry, I would never give my money to let alone move to some queerphobic Jew hating Muslim shit hole. Don't listen to the H@masniks around the world who only care about Jews when they're dead. Keep going Israel, you can do it. Never again is now.

Israel,Israel,"As an Irish Catholic, all of my family and friends are Pro-Palestine. Tbh I still wouldn't really say I am pro one side or the other, as it is a complex conflict and not like choosing sides in a football match. I feel sorry for innocent people on both sides. However, the more I learn, the more I sympathise with the Israeli perspective. I honestly think that the Pro-Palestine side is heavily reliant on 'buzzwords' which sound good on social media posts or when chanted on the streets, and twists a lot of the facts. For example, the way they frame the entire conflict is that of white settler-colonist Jews oppressing the poor indigenous brown people of Palestine. This resonates a lot with people in Ireland, who see it as equivalent to the long Irish struggle for national independence against the British. Indeed, people will point out that the British politician Balfour is a key figure behind both the partition of Palestine and the partition of Ireland/Northern Ireland. I now believe this to be a false equivalence.

This is my current understanding. It may be imperfect and please help correct me....

For a start, the majority of Jews in Israel aren't white. I think it's sad that this racial element is so important, but apparently it is. The Middle-Eastern, or 'Mizrahi' Jews are the largest Jewish group in Israel. They considerably outnumber the 'Ashkenazi' Jews, or Jews of European descendent. More importantly, even the Jews of European descendent ultimately trace their heritage back to the Levant. At the end of the day, Jews come from Judea and Arabs come from Arabia. This is an over-simplification. But it is true that Jewish culture and ethnicity has been in the Levant for at least 3,000 years. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by the Romans 2,000 years ago. The Romans renamed the land 'Palestine'; it is not an Arabic word. Arab culture and religion came in the form of conquest after the invention of Islam in the 7th Century. Arab Muslim conquerers built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock over the ruins of the temple on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. By now Arab/Islamic culture has been in the region for well over 1,000 years, so they should also be considered native.

Since the beginning of their exile 2,000 years ago, Jews have faced persecution wherever they went, either as 'Christ-killers', or as people who rejected the final Prophet, or later as racially impure. However, Jews never fully left their homeland, but remained a minority under centuries of Colonial rule by the Arab Caliphates and later the Ottoman Empire. Despite what most people in Ireland seem to think, the modern state of Israel was not created as a colony under British Imperialism. Jewish settlers began returning to their ancestral homeland to escape persecution in Europe from the late 1800's onwards, purchasing land from Arabs and from absentee landowners in Istanbul. They came as refugees, not conquerors. At that time Palestine was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire and its population was a faction of what it is today. Jewish settlers brought advanced agricultural and medical technology from Europe and helped transform the land and enable it to support a larger population.

The Jewish persecution ultimately culminated in the Holocaust and the murder of 6 million Jews, at which point the world agreed that the Jews should have their own state. The UN decided to vote the state of Israel into existence - as part of a 2 state solution - in 1948 (a vote from which Britain actually abstained). Instead of accepting the democratic decision of the majority of the world's nations, Israel's bigger more powerful neighbours (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq) decided to invade and try to wipe out the early state. Somehow Israel managed to win this war, but hundreds of thousands of Palestines were displaced as a result. My understanding is that many were told by the Arab armies to flee during the war and promised they would be able to return home after the inevitable destruction of Israel. On the Jewish side, hundreds of thousands of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East - who had been there since the time of the Roman exile - were forced by the governments of those countries to leave. For example, before 1948 Morocco had around 250,000 Jews and today it has less than 2,000. Iraq had 150,000 Jews, but today less than 5. Talk about 'ethnic cleansing'. The majority of the Jews of Israel today are the descendants of these refugees ('Mizrahi' Jews). I believe so much death and suffering could have been avoided if the Arab nations had accepted this 1948 partition plan.

Since 1948 Israel's Arab Muslim majority neighbouring countries invaded it 4 more times (6 days war, Yom Kippur War, etc.) and each time Israel has won. I believe a big factor in this is the effectiveness of military organisation in democratic states in contrast to authoritarian states. Since then, dictators in authoritarian regimes in the Middle East have had an incentive to keep the conflict alive in order to present themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause and distract from internal human rights issues in their own regimes. Therefore neighbouring countries have continued to deny subsequent generations of Palestinian refugees citizenship and equal rights. However, by 2023 Israel was in the process of normalising relationships with the Arab Muslim states in peace negotiations facilitated by Saudi Arabia. The greatest antagonist in the Middle East today (Iran) could not tolerate this, so planned for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israel beginning with the atrocities of Oct 7th.

This is where I believe the ability of an Irish person to understand the conflict breaks down completely. If we consider the 2 major groups of the Palestinian resistance movement to be the 'PLO' (Palestinian Liberation Organisation) and Hamas, I believe the average Irish person can see reflections of the 'IRA' (Irish Republican Army) in the PLO. They are non-state actors willing to use violent means to achieve regional nationalistic goals. A free and united Irish state, a free Palestinian state. Tbh I think the PLO are much more fanatical than the IRA and harder to negotiate with. In the 1970's - Black September - the PLO tried to assassinate the King of Jordan and started a civil war. They got kicked out of Jordan and moved to Lebanon where they started a civil war that transformed the country from one of the most stable countries in the Middle East to the Lebanon of today in which a third of the country is ruled by a terrorist organisation. 4 times the PLO were offered a 2 state solution, and everything they were asking for, and each time they rejected it. In the 1990s the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's genocidal persecution of the Kurds. In contrast, in the 1990s the IRA disarmed and accepted a peace agreement that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK until such time as - through democratic referendum - the majority of the population chose to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland.

Unfortunately, I believe the PLO are still more reasonable actors than Hamas, who are not interested in regional nationalistic goals such as the creation of a Palestinian state, but follow a globalist ideology of Jihad. If I understand correctly, Hamas don't even believe in the concept of the nation-state and believe that humans shouldn't be divided into different nationalities; there should just be Muslims and non-Muslims. They seek to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate. The fanatical Shia Mullahs of Tehran - who train and fund Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - believe that global conflict is a prerequisite for the return of the Mahdi and the end of the world. This includes key events in modern day Syria, Yemen and the return of the Jews to the Holyland (specifically Jerusalem). From an Irish perspective - concerned with regional nationalistic struggle - it is almost impossible to empathise with this point of view, or how organisations could seriously base their geopolitical strategy on such eschatological nonsense. For this reason, Irish people are completely blind to this aspect of the conflict. But this is exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah believe and why they can't be negotiated with. They live in a different reality in which life in the secular world is unimportant compared to the eternal hereafter. Hamas leaders have even declared that they love death as much as the Jews and Americans love life.

The IRA, as bad as they might have been, were motivated by nationalism, not religious fanaticism and would never have engaged in the kind of violence against women and children that was undertaken by Hamas on Oct. 7th. Many Irish people unfortunately see that day as an uprising similar to the Easter Rising of Irish rebels against the British government in Ireland in 1916. They can't see the conflict as anything but a nationalistic struggle against colonial oppression. Because how could anyone seriously believe in that kind of religious end-of-the-world religious nonsense? And this is what leads Irish people to view the conflict through the lens of the other key buzzwords; 'genocide' and 'apartheid' state. After all, the actions of the British government continuing to export food from Ireland during the potato famine were arguably genocidal, and Catholics remained second class citizens in the apartheid state in Ireland created by the Protestant Ascendancy of the 17th Century. Never mind that almost 20% of Israel citizens are Arab Muslim, some of which are lawyers, doctors, members of the Supreme Court. I believe that Arab Muslims in Israel have more rights and a higher quality of life than Arab Muslims in almost any other country in the Middle East. The benefits of living in a liberal democracy as opposed to living under a dictatorship or theocracy. And from what I understand the road signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English, which would be a very unusual step for an apartheid state to take.

It might not be surprising therefore that there are thousands of Arab Muslim Israelis in the IDF, as well as other religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Druze, who know how much better their lives are under a democratic government than they would be under an authoritarian or Islamic government like Hamas. I don't know how they expect us to believe that an army is committing genocide against a specific ethnic group, when that army itself has thousands of soldiers from that same ethnic group. There were zero Bosniak Muslim soldiers in the Serbian army in the actual genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s. The numbers also don't add up. 2 million people in Gaza, 44,000 dead, half of which are Hamas terrorists. The death of a single innocent civilian is heartbreaking, but it is a tragically unavoidable part of war. I believe many on the Pro-Palestine side are naive regarding the difference between war and genocide. The absolute number seems low for a genocide (compared to other ongoing conflicts in the region; 600,000 dead in Syria, 400,000 dead in Yemen). Also the combatant:civilian death ration 1:1 or maybe 1:1.5, whereas a typical modern urban war involves more like 4, 5 or 6 civilian deaths for every 1 combatant.

The fact that so many people are fixated on the number of dead is also unusual I think, and not typical of any previous conflicts. I truly believe that if social media and smartphones had existed during WW2, many supporters of the Pro-Palestinian movement would have been posting videos on TikTok of German children being pulled from the rubble and saying 'We have to have a ceasefire now, too many German civilians have been killed. The Allies are clearly evil. Let's give the Nazis time to regain their strength and build up their technology, but we just have to have a ceasefire now.'

One side is completely based on buzzwords, street protests and social media 'influencers'. The depressing part is that no one has the time to look into the history or geopolitical and religious nuances of the conflict, it's so much easier to watch a short TikTok video with emotional background music, or shout buzzwords in a street protest. The likelihood I will be able to convince any of my friends or family to re-evaluate the nuances of the conflict are so close to zero as to basically not be worth attempting.",t2_13hdmarw,"Why I changed from Pro-Palestine to Pro-Israel as an Irish person.

Israel,Israel,"On Oct 21st the IDF released a¬†[3D rendition of a bunker](https://youtu.be/zqwOt6Z3A0w?t=15)¬†underneath Al-Sahel hospital that it claims was used by Hassan Nasrallah and contains some half a billion dollars in cash and gold belonging to Hezbollah.

In¬†[the video](https://youtu.be/zqwOt6Z3A0w?t=29)¬†published in English, Hebrew, and Arabic, two underground entrances are shown connected to the Al-Sahel building and Al-Ahmedi building both of which are located to each side of the hospital but are not directly connected to it.

https://preview.redd.it/g237m907xbwd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95508ec2bda86889b5419015394210d8bdce85bd

Additionally, Israel's Arabic spokesperson¬†[Avichay Adraee](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee)¬†gave¬†[detailed instructions](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1848423905754493168)¬†in Arabic as to where the entrance and exit of the bunker could be found:

>Hezbollah keeps hundreds of millions of dollars in paper currency and gold under the Coastal Hospital in Haret Hreik to use for financing its terrorist activities.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è We reveal dangerous information about Hezbollah placing the shelter of the so-called Hassan Nasrallah under the Sahel Hospital located in the heart of Beirut.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è **The entrance and exit points are located inside the Al-Ahmadi Building and Al-Sahel Center Building.**

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Inside this shelter is a complex where hundreds of millions of dollars in paper currency and gold are kept, a large portion of which was taken from the citizens of the Lebanese state‚Äîfunds that could, and still can, rebuild the Lebanese state.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è The hospital's address is on Dargham Street, Airport Road, Haret Hreik.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è These funds are intended exclusively for arming the terrorist organization Hezbollah, with no other purpose.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Air Force aircraft are currently reconning the complex. We are monitoring it and will continue to do so.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è We call on the Lebanese government, governing institutions, and international organizations to return the funds stolen from Lebanese citizens, and not to allow Hezbollah to use them for its terrorist purposes.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Our war is not against the citizens of Lebanon, but against a bloody terrorist organization that Iran continues to arm and direct according to Iranian interests. üíö

Despite having clear instructions as to the entrance and exit of the bunker and being fully aware that it had no direct connection tot he hospital per the IDF's video, the BBC decided to tour the hospital itself rather than demanding to see the alleged entry and exit points exposed by the IDF.

It was at this time that Avichay put out a¬†[second Tweet](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1848644476287291576)¬†once again directing reporters to proper locations:

>To the media personnel who are currently participating in the media tour inside **#Sahel\_Hospital** in Haret Hreik‚Äîgo to the specific locations we have revealed and do not waste your time on theatrics inside the medical departments. Go down to Hezbollah's private shelter.

>Dargham Street, Building No. 7, Airport Road, Haret Hreik. **Entrance and exit in Al-Ahmadi Building and Sahel Center Building**.

>Go there.

This too was ignored by the BBC who then¬†[published a tour](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c9818n8v7d8o)¬†of Al Sahel Hospital where (naturally) nothing was found.

https://preview.redd.it/wmozayt8xbwd1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef889a0e8bab74b86fb524198e326fee90dc457b

Israel's International Spokesperson Nadav Shoshani once again provided the press with¬†[detailed instructions](https://twitter.com/LTC_Shoshani/status/1848721112458227745)¬†on how to access the bunker:

>To all the journalists in Beirut, including those who participated in the press tour in the Al-Sahel Hospital, these are the entry instructions to Nasrallah‚Äôs bunker we exposed yesterday:

>**According to intelligence information, one of the entrances to the bunker, containing more than half a billion dollars in gold and dollars, is on the eastern side of the basement of the Al-Ahmedi building, located south of the Al-Sahel hospital.**

>**The basement is on the second floor down (level -2).**

>**It is important to note that it is possible the entrance is hidden by various means in order to make it difficult to find.**

>We invite you to this site in which Hezbollah is holding money that was taken from the Lebanese people.

Despite having an obligation to seek out and report the facts, the BBC decided to abandon its journalistic obligations and instead carry water for Hezbollah by ignoring multiple detailed instructions on how to access the bunker opting for a performative ""investigation"" instead. In the end, the BBC got the headlines that it wanted but its readers did not get the truth.

Israel,Israel,"1) Better discipline in the IDF. Photos of Israeli soldiers with Gazan lingerie and threatening mutiny is far from professional in a military. I understand that many of the soldiers are reservists so they might be rusty or have never experienced combat, but this definitely needs to be addressed. Especially if we are going to have a large influx of Haredim be conscripted now. Israel needs to nip that in the bud immediately and not let them think they can do whatever they want, especially coming from Haredim society where they usually were able to get away with a lot.


2) Forge closer ties with countries that have a common enemy, specifically East Asian countries. Japan, South Korea, and Israel all have a common enemy, North Korea. While North Korea isn't a direct threat to Israel, they are very close with Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah and routinely share intel and sell arms. Israel also has to move away (but not completely) from China as a sign of good will towards SK and Japan. Japan and SK are technological powerhouses, with large economies, and powerful militaries. Israel could also become closer to Taiwan, although that's a pipe dream. While China is not as hostile towards Israel as say Russia, they are still an adversary. SK and Japan are surprisingly pro-Israel so it makes sense to be closer to them.


3) Drop Russia. Drop this facade of Israel letting Russia say and do what they want to Israel with the hopes they help contain Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah or not supply them with certain munitions. They won't stop. Russia is a direct threat to Israel. Russia is not Israel's friend. Israel should have directly helped Ukraine more instead of hoping not to anger Russia.

I boycotted Israel because everyone did it and said that you will get blood on your hands. And so I did it because I don't want blood on my hands. 

I have ridiculed Jews and Israel. By standing behind Nuterei Karta and Jewish Voice For Peace. Nuterei Karta, who doesn't mind the Holocaust. Jewish Voice For Peace who is bothered by Hebrew prayers. I swear. I shame to say this even. 

But then I actually discovered that Jews were the ones who wanted peace. They wanted their holy city of Yerushalayim and Chevron to be handed over to the United Nations and Palestine. They wanted Tel Aviv as their capital. The Arabs were against it. The Arabs wanted to destroy Jews from the holy land. As if that were not enough, they also wanted to destroy the Mizrahi Jews. They wanted the Jews gone. But the Jews did not surrender and struck back. Now they sit around complaining that Israel is doing apartheid and occupation. I'm going to be honest and say that I do favour a two-state solution but Israel must control Yerushalayim. 

I love everything what Mizrahi is. I eventually listened 800 times to Sarit Hadad in one month. I bought some Israeli DVD and VHS to watch movies and soaps as Tipat Mazal 

Israel is my third homeland, after Turkey and the Netherlands. I'm not sure if I can say this but I feel myself even cultural connected to Mizrahi Jews.

I grew up with very educated and smart parents, I got most of my education from home growing up, I barely learned about the holocaust in my public school, in fact the teachers were laughing about the furnaces because we didn‚Äôt know what they were used for. I am Christian but my first boyfriend was Jewish, and I have so many friends in Israel. Here is the main thing about how the Jews have contributed to every country, they work and get educated and get good jobs and go into the military, what do these Muslim immigrants do in Europe? For example in Paris they are shitting on the streets and completely being a nuisance I‚Äôll say it, thats what they are in these countries. And to the debate of people saying that Arabs are the native people, explain biblical times, explain the Torah, the Jewish people have been indigenous to the area until the Ottoman Empire happened and they were sent to Europe. There is so much common sense that my generation lacks, there is no want to be educated but to just believe everything you see on TikTok, and if people actually had the guts to watch the videos of what happened on October 7th they would see things differently. The fact that people see what Hamas did as a ‚Äúsign of rebellion‚Äù they complain about poverty when the aid and money they get from these other countries goes into hamas and not the infrastructure, which is another point I‚Äôll bring up, hamas plays the victim and sets children up to die so that they can get support.

Israel,Israel,">So you want to recognize the state of Palestine? By all means. Go ahead. Just make sure to note that since Palestine is a state, no-one living in it is or can be or will be recognized by your country as a ""refugee from Palestine"", that you are therefore defunding UNRWA, that there is no such thing as a ""right of return"" into another sovereign state in which one has never been a citizen or ever lived.   If you're not ready to so as a package, then please don't pretend that the purpose of recognizing Palestine is to promote ""a two state solution"".

>Given that there was never a moment in the last century when there was an Arab Palestinian vision of peace and two states where one of the states is Jewish - which means acceptance that no-one is a ""refugee from Palestine"" when already living there or as citizens of Jordan and other countries, and that there is no such ""right of return"" into the territory of the sovereign state of Israel of people who were never its citizens - then now might be a great time to start clarifying that.

>A recognition of a state of Palestine is a great way to finally clarify - is the other state in the ""two state solution"" the Jewish state of Israel? Or, is it, as Palestinians continue to believe, a temporary aberration that will revert to being Arab in due course?It is high time to ensure that any vision of peace by two states means that one of these two state is Jewish. And if not, it would be nice to finally know that your country recognizes Palestine because it believes that ""from water to water Palestine will be Arab"" - the original Arab version of ""From the River to the Sea"" - and that there is no room for Jewish sovereignty anywhere. Precisely the vision that animated Hamas October 7th attack and the continued support it enjoys among Palestinians. If this is why your country is recognizing Palestine, it would be a good time for Israel to finally know that.

>If not, if you genuinely believe in a two-state solution where one of the two is Jewish, then get off your bum and make it clear - that recognition of Palestine comes with a strong declaration and policy that no-one living in it is or can be or will be recognized by your country as a ""refugee from Palestine"", that you are therefore defunding UNRWA, that there is no such thing as a ""right of return"" into another sovereign state in which one has never been a citizen or ever lived. Then we'll know you're serious. Anything else is lazy virtue signaling, worthy of an Anthropology student in the US, not a government of a proper country.

Palestine,Palestine,"**I am done. I cannot, in good faith, live in Israel anymore**. I used to respond to people who asked, ""*If you don't agree with Israel's policies, why do you still live there?*"" by saying that I was born here, my family is here, and I don‚Äôt know anywhere else. Besides, I would add, living in the U.S. is similarly problematic, being a global state of terror.

But that‚Äôs not true anymore. I cannot witness the racism and fascism growing to Nazi-like levels and still feel at home.

I was born into an Orthodox Jewish family, raised in a Zionist environment, and believed that Jews are the natives of this land while the Arabs (""*there‚Äôs no such thing as Palestinians!*"") are invaders who would eventually be kicked out or reduced to third-class citizens.

I am moving out of Palestine in a few months with my immediate family.

I believe that October 7th, in future history, will not be remembered primarily as the day of the Hamas massacre in Israel but as the day the Palestinians succeeded in provoking the IDF to overreact so aggressively, so mindlessly murderous, that it kickstarted the collapse of the status quo. It marked the beginning of the global fight for Palestine receiving the wide support they‚Äôve sought for so long.

The population of Israel, while not yet awakened from the Zionist dream, is more divided than ever. About religion, about judicial reforms, about the war (no one is against it mind you, out of all but one knesset members!), about the hostages, about conscription, about the economy. The army is overextended more than ever. Eventually, years from now, a new generation will wake up and realize they are fighting for a cause that doesn‚Äôt exist in the real world, while the Palestinians are literally fighting for their home.

I could go on, but this is already too long. I‚Äôll just say this: if even 5% of Israeli Jews held similar views to mine, I might have stayed in Israel. But they don‚Äôt.",t2_70rsw,"I cannot, in good faith, live in Israel anymore",0.98,4420,1732159455.0,1732159455.0,215,tanget_bundle,1gw6pc4

Since the genocide began, I started going to a lot of protests against the occupation and genocide of Palestinians. (Organized by ""Radical Bloc TLV"" & ""Free Jerusalem"" on Instagram)
I found a group of Anti-Zionist friends there and we go to protests together when we can.
But It just doesn't feel enough... These protests are only met with curses, dirty looks and police violence.
The last protest I went to faced extreme violence from the police and 4 were arrested for doing nothing but holding signs against the genocide, and one photographer who just did his job taking pictures.
I have heard some people say individuals like me should take militant action against the IOF, but I'm only 19 and I'm not sure I can do that at all, others said I should leave completely because if I'm not helping to fight from ""the belly of the beast"" then I'm just another useless settler.
I don't know what to do, every day I walk outside, there's Israeli flags everywhere and it makes me depressed and hopeless, seeing their propaganda (""Together we'll win"") makes me angry and frustrated.

This morning, in a hospital in Jenin, Israel‚Äôs special forces executed 3 Palestinians after raiding a hospital in civilian clothing.

Palestine,Palestine,"CNN published a story about Israeli soldiers returning from Gaza committing suicide. They talked to family and friends of one soldier in particular.

They interrogated his colleague. It turned out the deceased was tasked with driving a bulldozer. His colleague is quoted saying that they were forced to run over people, dead and alive, in the hundreds.

The good thing is that the article begins with a warning that there might be disturbing details for readers. What's shocking though is that it is not about the horror of the trucks squashing people, no, rather about the story of the suicide of the soldiers.

Palestine,Palestine,"**Video Description:** Noa Argamani, a 26-year-old former Israeli captive that was brought back to Israel in June, has issued a statement via Instagram on Friday to correct the media after they misquoted her testimony at a G7 meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday.   
   
Various media channels, particularly those in Israel, had reported that Argamani had said that her hair was cut by her captors and that she was beaten or hit all over her body. In the statement, Argamani clarifies that she said that she had ‚Äúcuts‚Äù all over her head and that she was ‚Äúhurting‚Äù all over her body. She further stressed that her hair had not been cut, that she was not beaten and that her injuries came from a building collapsing on her after it was bombed by the Israeli Air Force.   
    
Noa Argamani was taken captive alongside her boyfriend at the Nova music festival on 7 October. A viral video of her being taken out of Israel on the back of a motorcycle was widely circulated in the media.

Bethlehem, once a city full of life, tourists, and people from all faiths, is now a ghost town. I visited the town recently and found many of the famous shops closed (e.g., the walled off hotel, Bab-Iddeir, etc).

Nonetheless, I wanted to share these photos I took during my trip with you to remind you that we have life, history, and beauty; that despite the constant attempts at our erasure, we will continue to thrive in our land.

billions of dollars in new bombs and fighter jets for Israel in recent days, according to a new report, despite US officials publicly expressing worry over the mounting Palestinian death toll in Tel Aviv's brutal war on besieged Gaza. The arms approved this week by the US president include deadly 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82
500-pound bombs, anonymous State and Defense Department officials told the Washington Post. The State Department last week approved the transfer of 25 F-35A fighter jets and engines, a US official added. The planes and engines are estimated to be worth around $2.5 billion. The sales have not been notified publicly, and there are no corresponding announcements on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's website where such notifications are normally posted.
Senator Bernie Sanders criticised Biden administration's approval of sending more weapons to Israel. ""The US cannot beg Netanyahu to stop bombing civilians one day and the next send him thousands more 2,000 lb bombs that can level entire city blocks. This is obscene,""

Palestine,Palestine,"UN‚Äôs Pramila Patten questioned by journalist on Hamas rape report claims ‚ÄúHow is this any different from the New York Times Story?‚Äù. From UNTV Press Briefing 4 March 2024.

‚ÄúThe reason I‚Äôm asking this is because there are real consequences to this report. I mean I know you keep saying the Commission of Inquiry need to go and do their investigation, which I believe they‚Äôre doing, but the Israeli ambassador to the UN has said publicly ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not going to cooperate with that‚Äô so that recommendation is already DOA I guess you could say. 

Are you at all concerned that this report: Sexual violence against women, is being weaponised as a way to continue violence in Gaza?‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

Pramila Patten, UN Special Envoy on Sexual Violence in Conflict, responds to questions from the press on her the recent visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank, and subsequent report. The report from her Office, arose from the official week-long visit to Israel at the invitation of the Israeli government, which included a 1-day visit to the occupied West Bank, between 29 January and 14 February. 

In the Press Briefing she stressed that the mission and report were not ‚Äúinvestigative‚Äù in nature, and that the purpose was to gather and verify ‚Äúinformation‚Äù not ‚Äúevidence‚Äù which she made pains to clarify were completely different. 

Patten stated that she did not meet with any survivors of sexual violence of the 7th of October attacks or it‚Äôs aftermath. She stated that she received information from Israeli representatives that ‚Äúa handful of survivors were receiving very specialized trauma treatment and where too traumatized to speak.‚Äù 

The team conducted 33 meetings with Israeli representatives, examining more than 5,000 photographic images and 50 hours of video footage, and had 34 confidential interviews including with survivors and witnesses of the 7 October attacks, released hostages, first responders and others including discredited Yosi Landow of Zaka at Kibbutz Be'eri. 

The report states that ‚Äúthe information gathered by the mission team was in a large part sourced from Israeli national institutions. This is due to the absence of United Nations entities operating in Israel, as well as the lack of cooperation by the state of Israel with relevant United Nations bodies with an investigative mandate.‚Äù 

Based on this information, the UN mission team found that there are ‚Äòreasonable grounds to believe' that conflict-related sexual violence occurred. The mission also determined that at least two allegations of rape were unfounded.

The team also visited the occupied West Bank, where Patten met 4 recently released Palestinian detainees who provided first hand accounts of sexual violence perpetrated by Israeli authorities in threats of rape, and heard concerns raised over ‚Äúcruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of Palestinians, men and women, in detention,‚Äù including ‚Äúsexual violence in the form of invasive body searches, threats of rape, and prolonged forced nudity.‚Äù 

The report made recommendations included calling for a full fledged investigation by competent UN bodies into allegations of sexual violence on October 7th, and a humanitarian ceasefire.

Palestine,Palestine,"Alright so, many Zionists are saying things along the lines of ‚Äúthere are so many ‚ÄòFree Palestine‚Äô protests, why not we have some ‚Äòfree the hostages‚Äô protests?‚Äù lemme give my response to this, first of all to this specific thing: The Pro-Palestine protests are because America is literally giving Isreal money to bomb children, so the protests are to get them to stop that. That is the goal of the protests. What would be the goal of a ‚Äúfree the hostages‚Äù protest? Israel is already trying to free the hostages. No government is giving Isreal money to not do so, or something like that. So this kind of claim really makes no sense‚Ä¶

Second, if you really wanted the hostages to be freed, then you would support a ceasefire, as that is the time when most hostages were released.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/24/israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire-begins-hostage-release-palestinian

Third, Hamas offered to free all hostages if Israel doesn‚Äôt enter Gaza. Israel refused.

https://archive.ph/votzD

Finally, i just have to ask, why are the 200-ish hostages, more important than the over 40,000 innocent Palestinians brutally murdered by Israel?

Palestine,Palestine,"Murad scrolled, landing on a few viral images that were circulating that morning. A news account with 250,000 followers that focused on Palestinian issues, had a picture of the bulldozer breaking through the border fence in Gaza, along with a caption in Arabic: ‚ÄúWhile the ‚Äòundefeated army‚Äô was asleep.‚Äù There was a group of Palestinian teenagers sitting on what looked like a captured Israeli jeep ‚Äî someone had captioned it ‚ÄúGaza today.‚Äù There was a grid of the faces of dead children, with the quote, ‚ÄúWhere were your tears when we were murdered?‚Äù posted by a young Palestinian influencer. The algorithm also served a post from an account Murad didn‚Äôt follow, a quote: ‚ÄúDo you support decolonization as an abstract academic theory? Or as a tangible event?‚Äù Murad shared all four of them to her stories.

Friends later warned her that a handful of her private Instagram stories were being passed among Jewish students at the university. She thought that someone must have shown them to the police.

The police officer asked her ""How can you support what‚Äôs in these images? Do you support Hamas?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt, she said. Prosecutors filed their indictment against Murad. Along with incitement, she was charged with ‚Äúidentifying with a terrorist group,‚Äù which brought the total potential sentence to 5 years in prison.

The cell at Hasharon Prison stank of sweat and feces, but at least it had a toilet; in the holding cell in Nazareth, there had been a hole in the ground. Several of the other inmates were young women who had been charged with incitement for social media posts. Every morning, the guards ordered the women to bend over, spread their buttocks and cough. One day, while Murad was undressing for a search, a guard pushed her into a wall and hit her. 

After a week at Hasharon, Murad was transferred to Damon Prison, where she was placed in a cellblock for those convicted of terrorism. The cell had beds for three women, but held six. Most of the women at Damon came from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Many were proud members of Hamas. They were serving long sentences for violent convictions. Until this moment, Murad had never met a member of Hamas.

Hamas leaders asked for Arab Israelis in swap deals because they wanted to put themselves forward as the power in this vacuum: by demanding the release of Israeli citizens, Hamas intended to send a message that the Palestinian cause did not stop at the borders of the occupied territories.

In the fall of 2023, Israeli negotiators reviewed Hamas‚Äôs terms. Hamas was willing to release female hostages, so Israel needed female prisoners to exchange for them. It just so happened that state attorneys had indicted a handful of women for incitement across Israel, for speech they had made on social media or at protests. Nineteen of those women were sitting in prison awaiting trial.

Murad‚Äôs name was on the list. This was not how she wanted to get out. Her lawyer tried to file a last-ditch objection, but it was too late.

When the Israeli government agrees to a swap, it publishes the names of the prisoners in an online list: crime, hometown, date of birth, ID number. Most of the people on the list couldn‚Äôt care less, because they are returning to the occupied territories. But for a citizen, returning to a home in Israel, the list amounts to social blackballing ‚Äî you are forever associated with the enemies of the state. Being on a list means that your life is over.

The prosecutor of the university‚Äôs disciplinary tribunal, sent an email to Murad stating she had violated the university policy against supporting terrorism. She was expected to make a point-by-point defense against this allegation. She wrote she would have preferred to go to court and prove her innocence but ‚Äúin spite of my objection,‚Äù someone had decided to release her as part of the swap. The campus prosecutor rejected every part of her argument, recommending that Murad be expelled.

She is also in bad shape for jobs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm studying computer science ‚Äî  Software companies do background checks. And with me, you don‚Äôt even need to. You just do a Google search. No one is going to let me work for them.‚Äù

If the law for inciting terrorism is written vaguely, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his own intentions plain. In February 2023 ‚Äî before the Hamas attack ‚Äî he appointed Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security, to oversee all the state‚Äôs efforts to prosecute speech crimes.

But that is not the whole story. Israel‚Äôs self-portrait as a democracy of all of its citizens was always in tension with its other mission, which was formalized in a Knesset bill in 2018: to be a ‚Äúnation-state of the Jewish people.‚Äù In practice, this means that the government can never act against the interests of the Jewish majority, from the divvying up of tax dollars to the flow of clean water to the zoning of new towns. Arabs are citizens of the country of Israel, but not members of the Jewish nation ‚Äî they are ‚Äúcitizen strangers‚Äù. They can never be full Israelis.

Palestine,Palestine,"Original post:

After over a year of campaigning across Ireland, we're delighted to say that Lidls on this island are now free of products made in Isra3l! Activists from every corner of the land regularly visited the retailer's outlets, distributing leaflets informing people of the cost of buying genoc1dal Z1onist goods, taking the products off the shelves and dumping them in trolleys, on the floor or at the front of the shop. Speeches were given to customers, Isra3li baby wipes were sealed up in yellow 'hazardous materials' bags, crime tape was left around the deadly items and all manner of other tactics were used to shame Lidl into stopping their funding of the aparth3id, occupying, genoc1dal state.

This is a massive victory for the BDS movement and people power, and shows what can be done by mass collective action across a large scale. It also shows that retailers can easily change their practices when put under sufficient pressure. We encourage other supermarkets to do likewise, and encourage all those with pro-Palestine sentiment to get involved in similar actions. BDS works!

Palestine,Palestine,"In this Palestinian valley west of Bethlehem, which in 2014 became a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its its olive groves and vineyards, the Kisiya family's restaurant is nothing more than a pile of ruins topped by fences.

It was a restaurant appreciated for its cuisine and friendliness in the Palestinian Christian town of Beit Jala. ""The place is beautiful, the food succulent and the owners are adorable [...]. If you're passing through Beit Jala, a stop at Al Makhrour is a must,"" a comment from 2015 reads on its Facebook page.

Ramzi Kisiya who had inherited the land opened a restaurant in 2001 there with his wife and their four children. For years, hundreds of tourists passing through Bethlehem stopped there for a salad before continuing their hike in the green valleys.

For a long time, the Makhrour valley was untouched by uncontrolled Israeli settlements, but the trouble began in 2012 when an Israeli outpost a settlement not authorised by the government - was built there.

The settlers demolished the restaurant, claiming it belonged to the JNF. The Kisiya family, who insist otherwise, rebuilt their restaurant before it was demolished again in 2013 and then again in 2015. In 2019 the family decided to take the case to court to have their rights heard. But in 2023, a civil court in Jerusalem validated the expropriation.

In a bid to prevent the family's restaurant from being rebuilt again, the Israeli army declared the site to be a ""closed military zone"", which prevented anyone from entering it until this nast summer when Israeli
settlers backed by soldiers destroyed it once again.

Israeli settlers backed by the army seized the 5,000 square-metre plot on July 31 and evicted the French-Palestinian family. ""We are being targeted because we reject the government's Zionist policy,"" said Michelle Kisiya.

Expulsions of Palestinians from their land in West Bank have increased, particularly since Israel's far-right government came to power in 2022. The situation has sharply deteriorated since Israel's invasion of Gaza last year.

Before parting, his father, Nawwaf, offered advice, urging Ayham to stand united with fellow prisoners, share resources, and remain resilient, reminding him that the jailer is the only enemy.

Just to put it into context I've been harassed at night by racists not even a few blocks from where I live. That being said I was having a conversation with a client in town about some services he wanted. This is a person with those hostages lawn signs and huge Israeli too. The client said that he had never gotten his property cleaned up and maintained. I relayed this to my Dad in Spanish. If you don't know the way to say ""never"" in Spanish is ""jamas"" pronounced ha‚Ä¢mas. As soon as those words left my mouth this guy exploded. Saying wtf was I saying, I was being antisemitic and unprofessional. I was able to deescalate and clear up his stupidity. Ultimately I told him I wouldn't give him any services after that. This is probably the most insane thing that has happened to me in this town. I've had Zionists refuse to shake my hand prior to 2021 and talk down to my enoloyees.

This support will provide over 1,500 metric tons of fortified wheat flour, which can make over 18 million loaves of bread that can help feed more than 157,000 Palestinians for one month.""

**This comes after Abel's $2.5 million dollars he donated to feed starving Palestinians back in December 2023, totaling $4.5 million dollars he's sent to Palestine!** Abel's also created a fund called, ""XO Humanitarian Fund"" to raise money to feed various communities, which has raised over $5 million dollars and a portion of that is also going to help feed Palestinians.

As a 13-year fan of Abel's music/work, I couldn't be prouder of him! Unlike these other celebrities who have been silent on Palestine's genocide or are proudly supporting Israel's apartheid-state, Abel has put his money where his mouth is to actually make a difference in the lives of Palestinians & to hopefully help save many of them from starving to death. Abel's also shared news/info about Palestine's genocide long before October 7th & used his massive platform on social media, to educate his followers about the mass ethnic-cleansing that Palestinians have been forced to endure for 75+ years! Thank-you, Abel, I'm hoping these meals truly help the Palestinians & most importantly, I'm hoping Palestine's genocide ends immediately!

Palestine,Palestine,"Neil Druckmann himself has admitted the game is an allegory for Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Seraphites as stand-ins for Palestinians and WLF for Israel. He admitted this before the game was even released.

Link for proof: https://www.vice.com/en/article/bv8da4/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii

1- The Palestinian stand-in in his game are insane deranged psychopaths. The game claims to be ""showing all sides"" but the Seraphites are just shown as unhinged crazy people and the only 2 ""good"" seraphites in the game side with Abby, the IDF stand-in.

2- Saying ""I'm not racist, I like this one trans Palestinian"" is called pinkwashing or rainbow imperialism. It's just justifying genocide using progressive sounding words. The character of Lev serves no point other than to portray Palestinians collectively as backwards anti-LGBT people.

3- ""Cycle of Violence"" is bullshit shitlib framing. The reason violence never ends in Palestine is that Israel is a settler colonial state whose mission statement is to eradicate Palestinians from their own land. ""Cycle of Violence"" makes it out to be some kind of misunderstanding and that Palestinians keep getting killed because they can't just ""forgive and forget"". There is nothing for Palestinians to ""forget"", the ethnic cleansing and their oppression is an ongoing process that happens daily in their lives, not something that happened one time.

4- Likewise, the game misrepresents the conflict by completely omitting the settler colonial nature of Israel. Abby and her friends are not keeping Seraphites in a racial ghetto in the game, so when Seraphites attack them you assume the Seraphites are just crazy people, which is what the author wants you to think.

5- In the end, the cycle of violence is ""resolved"" by just genociding the Palestinians. This is portrayed as something unfortunate but inevitable. The seraphites are shown so negatively by this point that most players won't really feel anything at all seeing them being genocided. In fact, the game spends the last moments before they are genocided to remind you that Palestinians are so unfathomably evil that the trans Palestinian's mother tried to kill her own child for being trans. Meanwhile in reality, it's not Palestinian mothers that kill Palestinian children, it's the Israeli army.

6- Neil Druckmann said he made this game because he watched 2 Israeli settlers be killed by Palestinians and felt hatred for Palestinians as a result. He said he was ""disgusted"" by his hatred for Palestinians but he also said he made the game so he could show everyone would feel the same hate in that situation. He basically felt he wanted to kill all Palestinians, then was like ""ok maybe not all of them"", and then made a game to persuade you to feel like you too, would want to kill all Palestinian, to make himself feel good about it. Except that most normal people do not want to commit genocide and Neil Druckmann is a psychopathic fuck, so instead it made everyone just feel the game was miserable for no reason.

7- He portrays the IDF as near perfect. Enormous amount of time is spent humanizing the IDF soldiers. Even the criticism of IDF which is that genociding the Palestinians is bad, is not shown to be a moral fault of IDF but rather, the Palestinians brought it on themselves by harassing the IDF too much.

8- Ellie is irrelevant to the story. The story is basically about Abby, the real protagonist. Ellie is basically just a stand-in for the American audience who over the course of the game learns to stop worrying and love the IDF. Joel is killed to simulate Neil Druckmann watching 2 Israeli settlers be killed and wanting revenge. Then every single person Ellie kills is shown to be actually decent people with hopes and dreams (because they are IDF stand-ins) and you feel like it's saying killing people is bad, then half way through you switch to Abbie and the game suddenly shifts to ""Hell Yeah, Kill all them backwards brown people"" style with none of the people Abby kills being shown as having been good people. The gameplay is identical between the two parts, but player is scolded for killing people in the first part and then celebrated for killing people in the 2nd part. Why? Because Ellie is killing IDF stand-ins who are human, and Abby is killing Palestinian stand-ins which is ""unfortunate but necessary"".

9- The story makes no sense if you don't know it's about Israel-Palestine conflict. Why are these two groups fighting over land in Seattle when humanity has gone near extinct, there's plenty of land everywhere, and neither of them have any meaningful connection to Seattle? Because it has nothing to do with Seattle, it's about Palestine. Why are the Seraphites using skyscrapers to ""get around"" WLF as if WLF is a state presence when they are supposedly another post apocalyptic faction with roughly the same strength? Because it's actually about Palestine. The story is completely and utterly nonsensical otherwise.

This game is basically ""Birth of a Nation"" for videogames. It's there to justify ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians by dehumanizing them. Serves no other purpose.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"I come from a background in nuclear power. I am invested in nuclear power. I have been around it for the past 15 years. We need to update our sentiment towards it. Overall it is one of the safest forms of energy out there. It is clean, reliable, and getting cheaper. [Especially with the advent of reactors from companies like Oklo for example, that can use recycled Uranium waste as fuel, waste becomes less of a problem.](https://oklo.com/fuel-recycling/default.aspx)Have you ever had a run in with this massive amount of nuclear waste that skeptics talk about? Me neither. It goes unnoticed, and it will continue to go unnoticed because it is really a non-factor.

While I agree that a world powered strictly from renewable energy is a good north star or ideal destination, we are not there yet, and while technology advances in the industries of wind and solar, so too does global demand for energy. Nuclear power to me is the perfect source of energy that can fill the gap between where we are right now with renewables and where we need to be in order to meet demand. The beautiful thing about nuclear power. You don't need wind or sunshine for it to work. It doesn't sleep. It just keeps powering and powering. Eventually we may even achieve fusion, but research and progress requires a positive sentiment.

If you don't know much about it, that's okay! I would urge you to research it, and question your biases, and help friends question theirs. I want to put a stopper in greenhouse gas emissions as much as anyone else and reverse climate change. Let's use the tools that we have at our disposal. And if it weren‚Äôt for nuclear power Mark Watney would have never made it back to Earth. End rant.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Despite the fact that the climate crisis is more prevalent than ever with extreme weather and (un)natural disasters walloping the world left and right, the percentage of posts discussing ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" on Reddit has actually gone down -- at least according to [a new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01974-8) that analyzed 11.5 billion Reddit posts over 16 years (2005-2021).

From the paper's conclusions:

>Over 16 years of Reddit posts show a decreasing proportional interest in climate-related topics. While the absolute number of climate discussions has increased, the expansion of other topics on Reddit has outpaced it, suggesting a relative decline in engagement with climate issues. This trend might be attributed to various factors, including topic fatigue, competition from other crises, and the emergence of other engaging topics.

The authors also noted that redditors talk about ""global warming"" in different ways from ""climate change,"" where ""discussions about global warming tend to use less sophisticated language and exhibit more positive sentiments compared to those about climate change.""

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Hello everyone!

I live in Upstate NY and my county alone has seen a dozen Brush Fires in the span of 48 hours, two of which being pretty severe and has destroyed A LOT of acres. We don't see many brush fires where I live. Sure, a few here and there but nothing at the rate of this and ESPECIALLY not in November.

I was having a discussion with my Grandma earlier today who's house is a few hundred feet away from one of the major fires. I brought up Climate Change being the cause and she shut me down right away. She said there was no such thing as Climate Change and this was ""Perfectly normal weather"" and things like this just happen sometimes. My Grandfather and Great Aunt who chimed into the conversation to conquer with her answer. I was in complete SHOCK! 

How can they deny Climate Change while a Wildfire blazes right by their house? How can they even call this Weather normal? I went Trick or Treating with my cousins a week ago and felt so hot in my costume. I checked the Temperature and it was 75 FREAKING Degrees, on Halloween, In the North East. How can people be so ignorant to the truth?

Sorry about the rant. I cant talk to anyone about this since most my family is Right Wing Trumpers who believe Climate Change is the plot of the Left :/

ClimateChange,climatechange,"A significant factor contributing to the environmental impact of animal agriculture is its inefficiency. Behrens pointed out that *converting plants into animal products wastes a staggering 80 to 97 percent of the calories initially present in the crops.* To produce one kilogram of beef, for instance, a cow must consume 25 kilograms of animal feed.  Behrens explained that humanity is exceeding six of nine planetary boundaries, which are thresholds that define a safe operating space for our planet.  Each of the four boundaries linked to animal agriculture paints a grim picture:

1. **Biosphere Integrity:** The loss of biodiversity is directly tied to habitat destruction caused by agricultural expansion. Farming animals displaces native species and fragments ecosystems, pushing many species toward extinction.
2. **Land System Change:** The conversion of forests and grasslands into agricultural land disrupts natural ecosystems, reducing carbon sequestration and exacerbating climate change.
3. **Freshwater Use:** Animal agriculture is one of the largest consumers of freshwater, contributing to water scarcity in many regions.
4. **Biogeochemical Flows:** The overuse of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to grow animal feed leads to pollution of waterways, causing dead zones and disrupting aquatic ecosystems.

>Methane emissions, a major contributor to climate change, have continued to rise without slowing down. Despite a global pledge by over 150 nations to reduce emissions by 30% this decade, new research reveals that global methane emissions have surged at an unprecedented rate over the past five years.

>The trend ‚Äúcannot continue if we are to maintain a habitable climate,‚Äù the researchers write in a Sept. 10 perspective article in *Environmental Research Letters* published alongside data in *Earth System Science Data*. Both papers are the work of the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), an initiative chaired by Stanford University scientist Rob Jackson that tracks greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

>The current path leads to global warming above 3 degrees Celsius or 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. ‚ÄúRight now, the goals of the Global Methane Pledge seem as distant as a desert oasis,‚Äù said Jackson, who is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the *Environmental Research Letters* paper. ‚ÄúWe all hope they aren‚Äôt a mirage.‚Äù

Here's a fascinating observation in the article about the impact of the pandemic on atmospheric methane accumulations:

>Our atmosphere accumulated nearly 42 million tons of methane in 2020 ‚Äì twice the amount added on average each year during the 2010s, and more than six times the increase seen during the first decade of the 2000s.

>Pandemic lockdowns in 2020 reduced transport-related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which typically worsen local air quality but prevent some methane from accumulating in the atmosphere. The temporary decline in NOx pollution accounts for about half of the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations that year ‚Äì illustrating the complex entanglements of air quality and climate change.

Richard is very upfront about not being a climate scientist himself, but has clearly done much research over many years. I'm looking for the view from climate change experts on whether what he is saying holds water, because I don't have the expertise to analyse it deeply myself. The article highlights a lot of really concerning data, and asserts/predicts a number of scary things. A few of which are:

* The temperature should have been falling in late 2024 as El Nino comes to an end, but it increased
* We saw +0.16¬∞C warming per year on average over the last 3 years
* Obsession over ""net zero"" emissions is missing another major contributor, Albedo. Because of this, many predictions about the temperature leveling off after hitting net zero are wrong and the temperature is more likely to continue to accelerate.
* Temperatures will accelerate well beyond the worst case scenario
* We are so far off of predictions that we are in ""uncharted territory""
* We will see +3 sustained warming by 2050

One goal was to piece together a broader picture of AMOC behavior since the late 1800s, given that organized observations of AMOC‚Äôs three-dimensional flow began only in the 2000s.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Kind of a personal rant but I'm open to advice too because god knows I need it rn.

I'm a junior in college studying climatology in the US. Like many of you, I've really been struggling with the election results. Obviously, Trump's climate policies won't be good, but we don't really know how bad it will get either.

I won't quit climatology. No way. But I don't understand how we're supposed to function under this administration.

I asked my research advisor about it, and he said that all we really do is just not mention climate change. I'm not really satisfied with this answer though (and also I don't think he knows how bad this could potentially get). Am I really just supposed to ignore the root cause of something just because some people don't like what I have to say because it might hurt their wallet? Quite frankly, I think that's bullshit.

I'm supposed to be a scientist. You report what's real. Climate change is real. I will not sugarcoat anything because then I'm not doing my job as a scientist.

Don't get me wrong I knew a 2nd Trump term was very possible, but now it's hitting me like a bag of bricks. It's always been my dream job to work with NOAA, but now that may not even be possible. I didn't even know if I wanted to get my PhD, but I think that decision has been made for me now. I've been thinking of going abroad for my masters (yes, I know many places abroad are bad right now too, but at least they're not dumb enough (or at least I think they're not) to deny climate change like we do here), and this has really amplified my desire. But that means leaving the life I have right now behind.

I'm torn between my loved ones and my integrity as a scientist and its so frustrating, and all this frustration is just pent up inside of me and there's just nothing I feel like I can do with it. I start applying to grad school in fall 25, so I'll really only have 6 months to see what damage this administration will havoc.

1. Our efforts aren't as nearly as great to make a system that captures carbon out of the atmosphere, with a net negative effectiveness (meaning not producing more carbon emissions than it captures). Oh, and did I forget to mention that if we by some miracle do this, we need a place to store the annual  **20-30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide** we emit that are set to increase?
2. Neither is our carbon pollution mitigation effort really making a [dent](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), 2023 and 2024 are record breaking years for producing carbon.

I wanted to share some observation regarding the weather here, in Yakutsk. I think it would be interesting to know about the things on the other side of the globe.

Here the average temperatures in January are minus 45 - 35 degrees of Celcius. If it's -50 degrees, kids don't go to schools. Water in the air freezes into ice particles and one should breath slowly lest you damage your lungs. Exposing your skin for over a minute can get you frostbite.

But not today. I checked and it shows that it's -10 degrees outside. It's incredibly warm for our standards, you practically don't need gloves and scarfs for walking around, you don't have to protect the face. Such temperatures are typical for April, when snow starts to actively melt here. It very much looks like spring came 2 months ahead of schedule.

While kids on streets cheer about good weather, adults are concerned. We turn freezers off to save electricity cost and keep some groceries outside such as beef. If the temperature is warmer than -25 then meat can't be stored for long and it can go bad. It's mainly boomers who worry about that and other down to earth things.

Weathermen assure that in a few days things will get back to normal. It is indeed cold as usual in places that are norther than Yakutsk, with 40 degrees temperatures still. It's unknown for how much it will impact flora and fauna, in particular there was problem of bears waking up too early and dying of starvation. Ecosystem is already fragile as it is.

However, [Porto Alegre was technically prepared for such events](https://diariodonordeste-verdesmares-com-br.translate.goog/ultima-hora/pais/por-que-porto-alegre-alagou-entenda-a-calamidade-que-deixou-a-capital-sem-luz-agua-e-suprimentos-1.3509373?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp). It has a dike and drainage system that could handle up to 6m of water (relative to the Gua√≠ba lake), more than the current flood (5.3m). Still, there was so much water that pumps started failing, causing more pumps to become overflowed in a cascade effect (it didn't help that the local government ignored some maintenances too).

**This is what extreme weather events look like.** You can tell yourself that you're safe because the geography of your area is different or that your local government is trustworthy, but ask yourself: are you really sure your city can handle 1,000mm of rain over a couple of days? Can the lake or river next to you handle it without overflowing? Can you reach the next city if all bridges get destroyed? Because extreme [rainfalls](https://www.nature.com/news/global-warming-already-driving-increases-in-rainfall-extremes-1.19508) and [hurricanes](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/09/warming-climate-makes-extreme-hurricane-rains-more-likely-for-puerto-rico/) are becoming more common thanks to global warming, and very few cities in the World are ready for this.

Naive, though that I could fight the other buyers that wants to buy the same area to take off the trees and sell as Timber (Very common business)
Then I realized I coun't cope with running costs of the land in a sustenaible basis (taxes, protection, etc). So I decided to start a crypto project to sell NFTs representing small peaces of the land. OMG, I got a lot of criticism, people saying ""thats Green washing"" , "" Thats a scamm"", I decided to stop the NFTs project and try to Certify the Carbon Credits originated from the protected land. It took me 2 years to Certify this shit.... Lot of certification companies didnt even want to talk to me over the phone. Then I found one in Sri Lanka, willing to Certify my land. 6 months ago, I got the Credits and no Company wants to buy because its not complaying with European Union regulations.
You know what? After 3,4 years later and almost 1 million dollars poorer I'm switching to the winning team. Lets sell this land to the Cattle farming business or a mining Company.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"There's a lot of posts about ""why bother if it's too late?"" 

A sense of futility is a very human thing, I get that, but to me, it's irrelevant, a waste of energy and frankly unbecoming to worry about if we're ""too late"" on this topic as if that should impact our decisions. 

Doing the right thing is its own reason and its own reward, not the chance or promise of success. 

A few years back, there was a tragedy in southern Spain where a two-year-old boy fell down an illegal borehole that had just been covered up some rocks. Specialized rescue crews converged on the site and worked nonstop for days, then over a week, to try to rescue that kid. Realistically, after the first couple hours, the chance that kid was still alive plummeted but nobody there talked about quitting. They worked until they finally recovered the body, but until that moment, all of the rescue workers said, ""we have to keep hoping.""

Of course, it goes without saying the parents were feverishly hoping and praying until the end. 

Climate change is just like that. It's all our kids down that borehole, but in our case, the kids aren't nearly as far down. 

What would you think of a parent that turned and walked away and left their baby in the borehole because it was too late instead of doing everything possible, and marshaling every resource to save the kid or at least recover their body? 

Yeah, that's right. We'd all think they were a worthless piece of shit and we'd be right. ",t2_otuoi,"""Too Late"" or not is irrelevant on this topic. Grow a pair already.",0.88,264,1719303417.0,1719303417.0,171,Leighgion,1do0v8o

>According to the report, ocean acidification is one of nine critical Earth system processes, or [planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html), responsible for regulating life-support systems on Earth. The planetary boundaries create a safe range for humans to maintain a stable and resilient Earth. When a boundary is surpassed, the likelihood of permanently damaging Earth's life-support functions increases significantly. With each boundary crossed, the risk of irreversible damage rises even more.

>Six of the nine planetary boundaries have already been violated, per the Potsdam Institute [report](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/earth-exceed-safe-limits-first-planetary-health-check-issues-red-alert), and if trends of ocean acidification continue as researchers have predicted, a seventh breach is not far behind.

It's disgusting how mounting species decline, even extinction, is so little discussed by American politicians and even the media.  Even collapsing fisheries doesn't merit concern, or even the degradation of the national parks.

EDIT:  Several of the comments reinforce my point.  A majority of Americans, as evidenced by the lack of concern among politicians and media, don't seem to understand the gravity of climate change impacts on the environment, living things, and certainly mankind.  E.g., a decline in the bird population will likely increase insect populations, negatively impacting among a host of things, agricultural production unless pesticide use increases greatly.

Saw this article just recently, and wondered whether the decline in the bird population also was a factor, although much warmer winters clearly is reducing winter kill-offs of insects.

<<McDermott says the dramatic rise of tick-borne diseases in Ohio is happening for a combination of reasons.

First, there are more ticks in the state.

Because of factors like climate change and reforestation, Ohio has more habitat for ticks than it did just a few decades ago. As a result, ticks are thriving here, McDermott said.

‚ÄúOhio is really on the forefront of tick expansion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe went from one tick of medical importance to humans, companion animals and livestock 20 years ago, which was the American dog tick, to five nowadays, including adding two new ticks in just the last few years.‚Äù

Plus, a lot of those ticks are carrying diseases.>>

Of course it‚Äôs important and a huge setback Trump will cause, but from reading these points of views, I‚Äôm getting a few concepts.

It‚Äôs more profitable and cheaper to use sustainable energy than fossil fuels, 

The market is moving towards new energy products like electric vehicles, and even nuclear energy, so whether the US likes it or not, the longer they disengage, the further behind in the market, economy they will be. Just for this its in most countries‚Äô interests to chase energy efficiency. 

The last time Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement, other countries stayed true. With their advancements and with renewable energy having economic incentive, US continues to lose its power and will be left behind. 

Eventually, even if the US was not compliant, the other countries with the majority will be able to slap taxes on us. Europe also has laws on imports to meet requirements for methane, so if we dont conform, we will only lock ourselves out of trade opportunities.

The US already has 10 million jobs in renewable energy compared to only 300k in fossil fuels. Even if Trump opposed green energy, there is naturally more economic opportunity there so regardless the market is going to go there.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"There's a lot of hoopla on this channel about disasters and why people live in these spots that are disaster prone like the LA hills. Drilling down into peoples actual mindsets though, the biggest thing most Americans actually fear - is a snowstorm. They'll put up with absurd amounts of other risks just to get away from the snowflakes.

When I lived in Atlanta for 2 years, I discovered a lot of people put ATL on their list because further north, there was the possibility of snow (like more than this last storm) and that was simply unacceptable. Like Kentucky isn't exactly an icebox, but it was out of consideration for a MASSIVE chunk of Americans because it snows there.

The vast majority of the godawful risky urban development that the US has is specifically in the no snow zone. That's how Florida, Phoenix, and SoCal spawned into such massive places with populations WAY above what would be normal. Most of the western US, which is actually the least risky disaster wise (floodplains should never be underestimated as Asheville displayed), is off peoples list due to the fact that the bulk of the area actually has a long winter period. The western US is a lot colder than it's eastern latitudes due to elevation.

The ironic thing is winter has never been easier. Think about it, pretty much every car is AWD. How did those rear wheel drivers do it in the past? Look at what they had for winter clothes in the 60's. The stuff was crap! Wool and rubber boots. The winter gear we have today is cheap relatively and simply amazing. I've never been actually cold while out snowmobiling.

Winter nightly lows are fastest warming metric of all climate. It really isn't as bad as it used to be. Minnesota used to be a wasteland of cold where -40s were something that happened in the winter. That's godawful temps, and they really don't happen anymore up there. Look at this last vortex, it was a breeze compared to the 2014 one, which really sucked (we visited MN when it happened). The reason beetles are chomping through the boreal spruce and lodgepole in the Rockies is the absence of -40F temps, again, gone.

So, I believe one of the most impactful thing we can do to influence people to make better climate decisions is to advocate for winter actually being an enjoyable season and combating this irrational fear that surrounds the season.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"EDIT : Yeah a lot of people have pointed out that its not that people dont believe in it and that its more that people are arguing about if its man made or no. So yeah i stand corrected oops lol

I have parents that try to be as ecologist as possible so I grew in an environnement where the climate change issue was always and will always be a real thing. 

But I do not understand why people would call it fake Underestimating it's impacts on their lives because it didn't impact them yet that I can understand. 

But denying it's existence with multiple proof and an overwhelming majority of scientist agreeing on the matter seems so weird to me ? 

Just why ? This question has been mind boggling to me. I do understand that a lot of people do prioritse the economy and other aspects over the environnement and I can kinda understand it especially if the effects didn't impact you yet due to human brain. (Like if doesn't impact me then it's no real until it impacts me). 

I dont understand what you gain by doing that. At worst just say you don't care and that's it. But actively trying to make it worse while denying it's existence is so weird to me

Did anyone had a the chance to discuss that with someone that doesn't believe in it ? Like that was actually opened to discussion and not telling that ""you're a sheep controlled by the government""?

ClimateChange,climatechange,"**My Background:** I live in the lovely northern state of Minnesota which right now is experiencing a drought all across the state from abnormal to severe conditions. The only people that seem to pay attention to things like this are people like myself who have a small family run farming operation in Wisconsin, also experiencing the same drought conditions. My mom who does the work on the farm tells me that ""you cannot educate the people who do not want to know"" and I think that this may be partly true but I also have a hypothesis that we have become so disconnected from nature that we do not appreciate it and we certainly have lost all respect for it. I come from a background of spending most of my life outside, where if I pulled a branch off of a living tree I had to apologize to it, where I had to learn about what bugs where invasive and which ones weren't and how to ride horse and why animals need to be respected or they won't respect you. 

**Why I Believe People are Disconnected:** What sparked this entire rant today was a single comment I made at work, ""I am hoping we are getting some snow soon."" You would think for a state notorious for blizzard conditions and long snow seasons that this would not be controversial but I was dog-piled by my group for even the mere mention of snow. ""Dont wish for snow!"" ""I want a winter just like the last one!"" (We got very little snow last year which is why we have been in a drought almost all year long!) This infuriates me beyond belief because I know these people believe in climate change and the first angry thoughts in my head are ""then why in the hell do you life here?"" I know I cannot confront people in this way so that is why I need to think about why are people so disconnected from the health of the earth? 

The vast majority of people now live in homes with central a/c and heating, soundproof windows, and warm insulation, which yes we need these things but what do they do? Our exposure to the elements has been cut off, it has been made optional. Listening to the birds, the wind, or just the sounds of the day have become something we choose not to do (or in my case I can't hardly stand having my window open where I live due to all the man made noise). In places like Minnesota and Wisconsin where I have lived my whole life people choose to not leave their homes when it's winter, which before climate change really started to show its true face would last a good 6 months and now its about 3-4, and would instead opt to stay inside, something that has become more and more of a trend as technology has become more prevalent in our lives. We no longer have community anymore, people do not go out and attend the big cross-country skiing events of yesteryear, do snowshoeing, ice skating, etc. I noticed this to be especially true in the larger city and suburban areas of Minnesota where people do not engage with one another, its really quite depressing. In becoming an urban people we have become so fragmented from the very ground that we walk on.

  
**I am Seeking Advice:** I come here seeking some guidance or ways to handle these frustrations, how can I approach people acting this way? It is easy for me to get upset that people do not understand that there is a drought, that wanting no snow will surely lead to no food/water, or wildfires. If I say these things to people then I become the ""bad guy"" because I am not only ""wishing for snow"" but I am actively bringing down everyone's mood by just simply telling them the hard truth that the world has not equipped them to hear. However I am really trying to engage all of those around me that I can because these topics are important and continuing to be ignorant to such things will only do themselves and others harm. 

  
***TLDR:*** people in MN/WI think having winters with no snow is good because they are so disconnected from nature they don't understand droughts. I believe people are disconnected from nature because of our urbanized/suburban/tech focused world where people never go outside and learn to respect the earth. I am looking for advice on how to approach these tough topics with people who come from these backgrounds that are so much different than my own so I can stop getting so frustrated but also hopefully get a good message across.",t2_ddngual,Even people who are left leaning seem under-educated on the climate - my thoughts from a farming background and seeking advice,0.95,232,1731615038.0,1731615038.0,239,SufferingScreamo,1grdzlh

ClimateChange,climatechange,"I'm from southern Italy, in the middle of the Mediterranean basin. There is a weather observatory near me that has been active since the 1920s. The older data are incomplete and sketchy, but it's still a valuable time series that shows the dramaticity of climate change in the region. The data shows that there was a slow cooling trend between the beginning of the series and 1953, then a moderate warming trend until 1973, then another cooling trend until 1991, and then a much stronger warming trend that continues to modern day.

The most recent warming trend of the last 34 years has been much bigger than any previous trend. There is a 2.5¬∞C difference between the late 1980s and modern day. That's approximately THREE times the global rate. And it doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon, in fact here is the list of recent records:

April 2018 was the hottest april ever

Overall 2018 third warmest year

August 2021 also the hottest ever

Overall summer 2021 third hottest

May 2022 second hottest

June 2022 hottest ever

December 2022 hottest ever

July 2023 hottest ever 

October 2023 hottest ever

November 2023 hottest ever

December 2023 second hottest

Overall year 2023 second hottest

January 2024 second hottest

February 2024 hottest ever

April 2024 second hottest

June 2024 third hottest

July 2024 second hottest

August 2024 second hottest

Overall summer 2024 second hottest (fitst place belongs to 2003)

Overall year 2024 hottest year ever BY FAR. Yes the year is not over yet, but at this point it's pretty much guaranteed that it'll end as the hottest year ever and by a huge margin. There would have to be a little ice age to bring the average down to non-record levels.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"I‚Äôve spent the past week talking to people about the recent US election‚Äîtrying to figure out, in particular, why people voted for Trump.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that people are trusting propaganda that visibly conflicts with reality. For example, many people told me they voted for Trump because they didn‚Äôt like how Kamala ‚Äúprioritized transgender issues while neglecting working people.‚Äù When I reminded them that Harris didn‚Äôt run on trans issues, and in fact avoided the topic entirely, they continued to believe whatever bullshit right-wing media had fed them.

How do we deal with this?

I‚Äôm concerned about the consequences for climate change because, although the scientific consensus is very clear on this subject‚Äîand although the average person has actually begun to *feel* the effects of climate change where they live‚Äîpeople have shown that they‚Äôre willing to completely disregard reality in favor of what the TV says. And what the TV is saying is that climate change is a hoax, that it‚Äôs an attempt by global ‚Äúelites‚Äù to usher in communism by penalizing businesses, etc.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Atmospheric CO2 is not a ""bad"" thing. In moderation. 

At 0 ppm, Earth would be too cold for life. 

For the last 2.5M years, up until the year 1900, CO2 levels oscillated between 160 ppm (glacial with Boston covered in ice) and 280 ppm (interglacial in which human civilization flourished over p12k years). 

The difference between 0 and 160 ppm is the difference between life and no life. 

The difference between 160 ppm and 280 ppm is the difference between glacial and interglacial. 

We have added more range (425 - 280 = 145 ppm increase) than the amount which differentiates a glacial and interglacial. 

The delayed reaction to what we have already done seems likely to doom human civilization. 

When you turn up the heat to high under a pot of water, it doesn't come to a boil immediately even though it is destined to boil out. 

The Earth is a giant pot of ocean water. Equilibrium takes decades to reach. But we have no mechanism to materially reduce CO2. The end seems inevitable absent some radical geoengineering.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"First things first, I don‚Äôt support this argument. I‚Äôm of the opinion that man made climate change is real and poses a serious threat. 

However, I was having a discussion about climate change the other day and my friend claimed that it wasn‚Äôt possible to state that the Earth is getting warmer solely due to humanity because the planet has a natural cycle of temperature increases and decreases. From this they wanted to draw the conclusion that a lot of the discourse around climate change is at best educated guesswork and that ultimately, if the planet is going to get warmer anyway, it doesn‚Äôt really matter how much of an impact humankind has caused. 

Being somewhat unprepared for this claim I didn‚Äôt really have an argument to hand to refute it, except for saying that the majority of mainstream climate scientists think otherwise. I couldn‚Äôt however cite anything particular, nor could I come up with a better refutation. 

All of which leads me here to ask if anyone does have a better argument against this idea, or could point me in the direction of some books/sources that might help me be better prepared for the next time someone springs that particular argument on me. 

Thanks a bunch! 

Edit:

Wow this got a lot of traction! Let me clear a few things up. 

Firstly, I am aware that the planets temperature does naturally change over time. This wasn‚Äôt the issue so much as the conclusion that since it‚Äôs going to change anyway humanity‚Äôs contribution can be written off. 

Secondly, I‚Äôm not trying to argue backwards from a conclusion I happen to agree with. I saw some people remark that I‚Äôm trying to cherry pick evidence, this wasn‚Äôt my intention. Just by using basic logic I knew it was a bad argument, however I didn‚Äôt have any evidence to hand that could help me refute it. What I was looking for were sources to support the claim that humanity has contributed directly to climate change despite the planet naturally changing over time. The timeline that was posted xkyd is a great example of the sort of thing I was looking for. The argument that the climate change is a natural occurrence is something I‚Äôve come across before, but not something I had directly had to argue against, hence why I was trying to find sources I could cite in future. I might have framed it badly, so that‚Äôs my bad.

Lastly, whilst I appreciate all the responses, I hope no one takes offence to me not directly replying to each one. There‚Äôs over a hundred comments on this post and it has taken me the better part of an hour to read through them all, let alone reply. I want to thank you all for your perspectives and suggestions.

Before the plunge in temperatures at the end, you can see Earth at 18¬∞C even AFTER the Anctartic Circumpolar Current had appeared.


This is very significant, because this means that some 600 ppm of CO¬≤ could get us to the limit of the icehouse/greenhouse.
That would be, no Greenland, West Anctartica, Arctic sea ice; only a diminished East Anctartica would remain.

This land area burned by the 2023 Canadian wildfires is much less than reported last year.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"The United Nations weather agency has issued a ""red alert"" on climate change after record heat in 2023. It is expected this year, 2024, will be worse than last year.

Ocean temperatures are currently on an alarming rise, reaching  unprecedented levels in 2024. This increase in temperature has serious  consequences for the ocean's ecosystems and human populations.  Rising ocean temperatures can lead to mass coral bleaching, a deadly  phenomenon that decimates coral reefs, crucial to marine biodiversity.  Corals are the foundation of many ecological systems, supporting countless  other organisms.

[Each line is the ocean temperature during a given year \(1982 through 2022\). The mean ocean temperature is the dotted black line. The colorful lines are the ocean temperatures in the last few years, showing them to be the hottest on record. The dark black line at the top is what it was in 2023. Already in 2024 it is higher than 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/gs6vezt3flpc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17673adb8e97de50040510a941f7444c8bdccdf2)

[As the atmosphere heats up, the oceans heat up, potentially causing a rise in sea level and a disruption of vital ocean currents that regulate weather around the world.](https://preview.redd.it/8zg7cn88elpc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=402bd7ffae2a9abc1549537c46f692b8b26f7d11)

The loss of coral reefs would have devastating  consequences for marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions who  depend on them.  Furthermore, rising ocean temperatures affect marine species' ability to  adapt. Warmer waters can cause changes in distribution patterns, making it  challenging for organisms to find suitable habitats or locate food sources. This could result in mass extinctions and the loss of crucial linkages in  ecological chains.  Rising ocean temperatures also pose risks to human communities.

Rising sea  levels can threaten coastal areas, causing erosion, flooding, and  destruction of infrastructure. Additionally, warmer waters may lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, harming fish stocks and disrupting  marine ecological balances.

>And a parallel report by [Climate Central](https://www.climatecentral.org/report/2024-hurricane-attribution), a nonprofit scientific research organization, applied the techniques developed in the Environmental Research paper to the 2024 hurricane season, finding that climate change increased maximum wind speeds for all 11 Atlantic hurricanes in 2024, increasing their highest sustained wind speeds by nine to 28 mph (14-45 km/h).¬†

>Potential intensity theory was pioneered in 1987 by MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel, who theorized that the wind speeds in hurricanes can be expected to increase about 5% for every increase of one degree Celsius (1.8¬∞F) in tropical ocean temperature, assuming that the average wind speed near the surface of the tropical oceans does not change.¬†[Computer modeling has found](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/17/18/1520-0442_2004_017_3477_iocwos_2.0.co_2.xml)¬†a slightly smaller magnitude (4%) for the increase....

>Although a 10% increase in hurricane winds because of climate change may not sound like a big deal, it matters a lot because hurricane damage increases exponentially with wind speed. For example,¬†[according to NOAA](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/), a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 km/h) winds will cause 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds.

apparently Greenland appears to be a net sink of methane, rather than a source

"" It has long been thought that the Arctic may be a ticking climate bomb. As local temperatures rise and permafrost thaws, more and more of the greenhouse gas methane is released. But in a new study from the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management at the University of Copenhagen, researchers have been able to conclude that at least Greenland does not seem to be a methane bomb after all. 

"" dry landscapes of the ice-free part of Greenland have consumed more than 65,000 tons of methane annually from the atmosphere, while 9,000 tons of methane have been released annually from its wet areas. 

The same could be occurring for other thawing permafrost areas such as Siberia, however the research that started to investigate this was stopped by the Russia/Ukraine war

"" We had just managed to demonstrate that methane uptake occurs in dry Siberian soils as well, but more studies will be needed in Siberia to provide a methane budget similar to what we now have for Greenland. ""

- Critiques renewable energy policies
- Alleges political/financial motivations behind climate science consensus

Has anyone else read the book yet?
I just started reading because the reviews all say how greatly the explanations are and how much they've been misled.

I am dumbfounded about the statements made in the book so far and don't know how people believe anything in this book but I can see how it appeals to people who are not going to do their own research.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Idk if this will get aproved or not, I just want to take some weight out of my body. I will probably delete this account in a week or so.

I am a young person (19yo) from Argentina who lived in a middle sized city 17 years of my life, and I am deeply worried. I just started reading deeply (at least that's what I guess) about CC around a month ago and I feel very hopeless, perhaps desperate, perhaps distressed, Idk, I watched some James Hansen paper presentations, reading a bit about Simon Michaux, heard the interview that Nate Hansen did to William Rees, read some articles of the LtG paper and it's updates, read some presentations about MIT books. All of those things built up the stress in my body regarding the possble collapse of Modern Human Civilization and I don't know what to do. I talked to my psychologist about this and she told me to stop reading so many negative news, that it's just the media that's trying to get people to read them for ads. Idk if that's true when I am the one actively seeking them out.

I study physics in part thanks to sci-fi and my grandfather. He is a massive fan of space, UFOs, physics and Carl Sagan, always telling me about how intelligent and wise he was. How he dreamed about this massive space exploration and settlement ideas, how he and his team convinced the USA and USSR from not destroying the world with nukes. The idea of a galaxy rise. I felt sad and hopeless when I saw his speech in the 80s in front of the US congress talking about climate change and Assimov's speech in American Humanist Association. If the smartest and wisest people I know of couldn't convince the world to do something, who could?

After this month I was left looking through many subs and interviews a sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing, at least in my view. Some coments and questions I have read: 

-""If society were to collapse, would we return to our current prosperity and technological levels at some point?"" A: ""No because we have mined all easy access ores and energy sources in this planet so you wouldn't unless you have the required technologies and energy which you won't get anyway because of lowering EROI""

-""At least after the extinction of humanity the planet will recover"". 

-""Oh well, humanity was always a plage/cancer cell/parasite/plague to the planet anyway""

-""You are living in the end of the high prosperity times. Enjoy it while it lasts""

I feel like I can't accept this coments because of how many good people I have met and made friends with. How many of them are alive thanks to modern medicine. Even when I went to college in a big city, the people there helped me and guided me. Where to go, where not to go, what to do, how it's done and so on. All of that made me have faith in humanity and it's empathy. Am I just doomed to see them and myself die if society collpases? Because let's be honest, at least me, I don't have any of the skills, tools nor emotions to survive such scenario, I would most likely curl in a ball and die at some point.

I could always turn around and see the progress we have made so far but I honestly don't want to fool myself because at least in my college, if you have a score of 1/10 in a test it's called **insufficient**. Having a president and an appointed head of the national science comission say that climate change isn't real doesn't makes me more relaxed. Neither does the fact that many of the people I listed are not talking about whether people somewhere will suffer or not but rather about whether we will survive or not. My obsession problem has reached a point where I can even identiify certain ""doomer"" users and actively avoid reading their comments because I don't want to be even more burried in sadness.

I am no man for politics. Yes, I had my phase where I tried to get into it and swinged between ideologies as fast as the ""I am 16 and I want to get into politics"" video until falling back into undesided but even in that phase, when I saw kids and adults march and discuss about politics, I just shruged and thought ""that's for the adults to do. Like voting, drinking and marring today"". So Idk what to do. I am trying to reduce meat consumption to as low as I reasonably can for a person with no education in nutrition and I talked to my father about Climate Change. Funnily enough, he just shruged the same way I did and said something along the lines of: ""We can't know everything in the world, much less worry. That's why we have specialists.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"In Rodanthe, N.C., seven homes have been lost to the ocean in the last four years, as rising sea levels erode shorelines and put more buildings at risk.


In North Carolina, climate change has caused the sea level to rise by about half a foot since 2000, and the level could rise by about another foot by 2050, said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.


Rodanthe, located on Hatteras Island, is home to many oceanfront properties with elevated houses sitting on pilings that were once surrounded by dunes and dry sand. Now, that land is often partially or fully covered by water, which erodes the sand around the pilings that support the homes, creating the risk of a collapse.


Officials said that residents facing the threat of home collapse have limited ‚Äî and largely unappealing ‚Äî options.

They can move their home to drier ground, a costly and logistically complicated process that is not always feasible. They can pay to have their home demolished. Or, they can wait until the home collapses and then seek reimbursement through insurance, if covered.

>Meteorological drought is simply a lack of normal precipitation, whereas a flash drought is marked by an especially rapid onset or strengthening of drought *conditions* (e.g., agricultural or hydrological drought, related to deficits in soil moisture or water storage). Meteorological drought can occur without unusually warm temperatures, but drought *impacts* are intensifying as a result of human-produced warming that‚Äôs increased the prevalence of ‚Äúhot droughts.‚Äù

The article explains how the current drought conditions in the U.S. may be the beginning of a prolonged drought, as occurred in the early 1950s.

>Across more than 1,500 months that populate the NOAA database going back to 1895, there‚Äôs only one that has a clear edge on October 2024 for national-scale dryness: October 1952.

>As of October 21, this month has notched about 0.57 inches of precipitation when summed across the contiguous United States, according to climatologist Brian Brettscheider (see embedded post below). Typically, each calendar month produces between two and three inches.....But the extreme outlier was [October 1952](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/pcp/1/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000), which saw only about half of that amount ‚Äì¬†a mere 0.54 inch, according to NOAA (0.52 inch in the ERA5 reanalysis data used by Brettschneider).

The article notes that October 1952 drought conditions were a prelude to the great U.S. drought of the 1950s, which ""across some parts of the Southern Plains ... actually outdid the 1930s Dust Bowl in terms of both precipitation deficits and intense heat, forcing [more than 100,000 farms and ranches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_Texas_drought) to close in Texas alone and pushing many thousands of people off the land.""

Of course the 1950s did not suffer from the impacts of climate change.  A worry should be that the current drought conditions may not be temporary and may actually accelerate, most especially if mankind doesn't aggressively reduce fossil fuel emissions.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"It is an issue, and I am certain that most people acknowledge it as such. But, at the same time, most people are not willing to give up on their daily rituals, activities, or vices, to slow it down. And I understand them. But what can we do? We rely heavily on hydrocarbons; they are what allowed modern society to exist in the first place. Farming, for instance, requires ammonia-based fertilizers, which in turn require hydrogen to produce it, and the cheapest solution right now is to use methane as the reactant. Vehicles require steel, and most of the steel is produced in blast furnaces as it is the cheaper solution - the alternative is an electric arc furnace, but it requires **a lot** of energy. Airplanes and ships use kerosene because the power density per meter cubed is significantly higher than any of the available battery technologies. Cement, plastics, textiles, paint, their manufacturing depend on hydrocarbons. Electric vehicles are here to save the automotive industry, not the planet; they require steel, semi-conductors, and battery manufacturing involves energy-intensive processes. Not to mention the developing countries, whose energy requirement per capita is increasing.

The way I see it is, there is no stopping it right now. Sure, we could plant more trees or be more conservative in our consumption. But the pieces are already in motion. We grew accustomed to comfort and it is difficult to give it up now. Also, companies are not willing to change to greener alternatives because they are not as efficient and are, arguably, more costly. So it is us, wanting our comforts and inexpensive alternatives, and them, wanting their profits.

I believe that the only two breakthroughs that can significantly slow it down are: modified crops that can produce their nitrogen for photosynthesis and nuclear fission. Any other solution would require EVERYONE to partake, such as lowering the meat consumption per capita, integrating more legumes in our diets, using local transportation, throwing less food and whatnot, which, unfortunately, will not happen any time soon.

4.  I'd like somewhere that's *not* prone to a major disaster (earth quakes, hurricanes, rampant wildfire, etc)

Let's just say dying to a cascadia megaquake isn't on my bucket list.

I've been looking at [this map](https://i.redd.it/uc52j9cgrfc51.jpg) of us snowfall.  I expect that snowfall to shift northward with global warming, but the question is *how much*?  I know current estimates put us at warming by 2.1C by 2050, but we're already ~ 1.1C over baseline so really that's only another 1C of warming, warming is 2x over land so we're back to 2C effective warming.  I've been playing around with [this map](https://impactlab.org/map/#usmeas=absolute&usyear=2040-2059&gmeas=absolute&gyear=1986-2005&usrcp=ssp245&usvar=tasmin&usprob=0.5)

Don't think for a minute I'm minimizing the danger of climate change overall, but that doesn't shift days well below freezing by as much as I thought it would.  I question how much northward the 'rare snow' line moves?  I'd love to hear arguments against though!

My overall point is that unfortunately the PNW is off the table, and given the sheer amount of snowfall the great lakes region receives I think that's off the table too.  I'm considering eastern TN, maybe Chattanooga due to the above as well as it's fast internet and low taxes.  Where would you move in the US if you were me?

Oddly, it seems the evergreen trees are fairing better than the broadleaves (especially when it comes to young trees). You think if it were related to heat, the evergreens would be doing worse, since they tend to favour cooler climates. Either way, reforestation is looking to be a lost cause; I'd say at least a third of the new trees being planted here don't last longer than three years.

Only slight suspicion that it is due to climate change.  Indeed, not even assured it is happening worldwide.  Significant declines have been found even in remote forests, far from pesticide use.

Wags term it ""windshield phenomenon"" since a car windshield is a poor-man's sampling device for flying insects (and aliens per ""Men in Black"" film intro).  Those who drove in north Florida in the 1970's  learned of ""love bugs"" which coated windshields until you had to stop and wash them off to see.  They appear to have migrated from Central America via the Gulf Coast.  They have declined, but not thought due to whatever might be affecting all insects.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Editor‚Äôs summary From Science.org

‚ÄúIt is easy for countries to say they will reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, but these statements do not mean that the policies they adopt will be effective. Stechemesser et al. evaluated 1500 climate policies that have been implemented over the past 25 years and identified the 63 most successful ones. Some of those successes involved rarely studied policies and unappreciated combinations. This work illustrates the kinds of policy efforts that are needed to close the emissions gaps in various economic sectors. ‚Äú‚ÄîJesse Smith

Abstract

Meeting the Paris Agreement‚Äôs climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning‚Äìbased extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO2. Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.‚Äù

In response to my post, I got enormous pushback from 90% of people, all saying basically yeah climate change is happening but these are just a few hot days not a trend, why be a jerk about it, and just enjoy the warmth like a normal person. I guess it's cool to love the effects of climate change while still smugging liberal by showing off your belief that climate change writ large is real. It's even more rich coming from a state that prides itself on its ""tough New Englander"" image, replete with putting on tire chains, skating on frozen ponds, and taking the T to ski at Wachusett. Like, none of those things are going to happen this year or probably any that follow...

I've decided that most people think like the following: abnormally warm weather is ""nice"" and, after having experienced a couple weeks of it, anything less than that abnormally warm weather is ""cold"" and thus bad. Like, it's going to be 77 in a couple days here, and I know for a fact that the news is going to say that when it drops to the upper 50s the next day that ""the cold will return"" or something like that, even though the upper 50s are themselves what would've been considered abnormally warm a couple decades ago. 

One comment on another sub I read recently said that they think no one seems to care about climate change since the pandemic. I think that's true. It's like how people are way less aghast by Trump now than 4 (let alone 8) years ago. We're kind of tired, bored, and nihilistic as a nation now.

 And now, a new *Frontiers in Bee Science* study has found that the rising heat caused by global warming might be a reason for the decrease in numbers across the globe.

""The decline in populations and ranges of several species of bumblebees may be explained by issues of overheating of the nests and the brood,"" Peter Kevan of the University of Guelph in Canada and lead author of the study said in a statement. ""The constraints on the survival of the bumblebee brood indicate that heat is likely a major factor, with heating of the nest above about 35 degrees Celsius being lethal, despite the remarkable capacity of bumblebees to thermoregulate."">>

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Hey everyone!

I understand the obvious link between increased CO2 emissions & global warming (greenhouse effect).  However, I've seen news articles linking climate change to a bunch of other weather patterns -- everything from hurricanes to extreme cold to droughts & fires.  I don't quite follow the direct link and was wondering if someone can provide more data / science behind this.

My gut feeling would be:

1. The average temperature is getting warmer (and may cascade due to polar ice melt)
2. This is causing weather changes & rise in sea level which could affect coastal communities
3. Some win and some lose, some places see additional rain, and others see additional drought, others may see more mild winters & a longer growing season, which could be good or bad, just different.
4. Hurricanes/storms/events may be more prevalent in some places, and less prevalent in others, due to these changes
5. But are there really ""more hurricanes"" on ""stronger storms"" or ""more polar vortex cold spells"" in aggregate, e.g. compared to historical patterns from the early 1900s?

The largest recent event happened during the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù (13th to mid-19th century): the ‚ÄúMaunder Minimum,‚Äù an extended period of time between 1645 and 1715, when there were few sunspots.   
    
>Several studies in recent years have looked at the effects that another grand minimum might have on global surface temperatures. These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down (but not reverse) human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth, and just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the grand minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Hey climate change subreddit

**Context**

Thought you might find this interesting, especially if any of you might be a little down regarding the potential AMOC collapse that has been in the media in the last year. I know I certainly have been mentally affected by it, so I made up my mind to gauge what the governments internal response has been to the research that has been put out.

I made a freedom of information request to the danish government, more specifically to the danish ministry of climate, energy and utilities in the beginning of november. The ministry and DMI (The Danish Metrological Institute, and it's National Center for Climate Research, NCCR) worked together to create the response to my FOIA request.

I had several calls with a number of public servants in regard to my request, all very valid and nice conversations, before it was delievered in full to me on friday.

**What is the basic TL:DR of the response to my FOIA request (in english)**

the NCCR at DMI fundamentally disagrees with the methods used in recent major journal articles about an imminent AMOC collapse, as well as the assurity of the conclusions from the reports. Primarily from a source and method reason, as well as how overblown the media perspective has been on the issue.

Regarding the Copenhagen study that made headlines in the second half of 2023, they believe the entire study relies on only a single parameter, which does not even include direct measurements of the atlantics current's flow. Studies on ocean current strength conducted by the NCCR at DMI and the Faroe Marine Research Institute actually show the opposite: the flow is currently increasing, while at the same time, the temperature of the atlantic current is increasing, which is even more concerning for the pace of Greenland ice sheet melting.

[Volumetransport of water \(million of cubic meters of water per sceond\) of the AMOC in the last 29 years](https://preview.redd.it/9zktn6j5094e1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=38b809a741e54fe3e6b37ae1d76f7edcd7e16869)

The latest major study regarding AMOC collapse from the Netherlands in 2024, which also made headlines because it partially confirmed the Copenhagen study from 2023, is considered the first interesting study by the NCCR at DMI since it at least involves several parameters of the currently used complex climate models.

However, the NCCR at DMI still find the method problematic because the study is based on an unrealistic premise: a pre-industrial CO2 level over 1,000 years and a Greenland ice melt rate 60-80 times higher than the current rate. This, NCCR at DMI argues, cannot be considered a realistic starting point for evaluating the current impact on AMOC, since the CO2 level is higher, but the melting rate is so much lower at the present moment.

DMI thus supports the IPCC's assessment that a tipping point for AMOC is unlikely to happen within the current century. However, they stress a lot that it is crucial to do everything possible to avoid a scenario where this collapse does become relevant, as each degree of temperature increase raises the likelihood of an AMOC collapse.

It is also clear that this aligns with the messaging from the ministry and the minister himself in their external communications with the media, which are also entirely in line with DMI.

What does not appear, however, is whether the ministry might be preparing reports on the potential impacts of tipping points on Danish industries. From my conversations with both the Climate Ministry and DMI, it is not immediately clear to me that anyone is conducting such studies. The Climate Ministry referred me to the possibility that such investigations would likely be carried out by Dansk Industri (Confederation of Danish Industry) or Landbrug & F√∏devarer (Danish Agriculture & Food Council). Which I find concerning, that it would be the lobby organisations doing that research.

Apparently, long-term global warming trends and long-term heatwave trends are causing heatwaves in the United States and many other countries to become increasingly more frequent, increasingly more intense (hotter), and increasingly longer lasting, while the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of summertime temperatures is arriving increasingly earlier in the year and is ending increasingly later in the year, with global average summertime temperatures rising increasingly higher each year.    
         
At the same time, the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of wintertime temperatures is arriving increasingly later in the year and is ending increasingly earlier in the year.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"The first of a two-part series on the AMOC, this article is one of the most thorough discussions that I've seen of the risk posed to the AMOC by climate change.  For persons well familiar with the AMOC threat, these paragraphs from late in the article may be most informative IMO (BF emphasis added).

>Once corrected and recalibrated, the cable data were in much closer agreement with the other platforms, showing no significant change in the Florida Current during the past 40 years of measurements. **And because the Florida Current is such a large part of AMOC, the corrected data cuts the observed decline from 2004 to 2022 in total AMOC transport almost in half, from an original drop of about 14% to a revised drop of about 8%....**

>So in summary, we have at least some reassurance from the North Atlantic data that a full-on AMOC collapse hasn‚Äôt begun. And it‚Äôs unlikely that any future collapse would reach its end point any sooner than the early to mid-2100s. **Yet there‚Äôs also legitimate concern ‚Äì stoked by recent work from climate modelers and statisticians ‚Äì¬†that a tipping point toward eventual collapse could arrive as soon as the next several decades, especially if fossil-fuel emissions aren‚Äôt cut sharply.**

Because climate change impacts are interrelated, I wonder if discussions of the AMOC are paying insufficient attention to accelerating collapse of the Greenland ice shield as global temperatures increase and to the possible impact of wind stilling on the AMOC.  Just accurately measuring the AMOC may be insufficient in accurately projecting the future impact of climate change on the AMOC.

Unfortunately few Americans understand the impact of a slowing, let alone collapsing AMOC, if they've even heard of the AMOC.  The potential impact on U.S. East Coast sea level rise is rarely (more likely never) discussed in the media or by politicians.

>Surface air temperatures over northwestern Europe could plunge far below current readings, even in a world otherwise warmed by human-produced greenhouse gases. Everything from agriculture to migration patterns could be profoundly affected. More modest drops in annual temperature, mainly during winter, could spread as far as the United States as well as encompassing most of Europe. And the average sea level could jump by as much as a meter (3.3 feet) along the U.S. East Coast, on top of the higher water produced by warming oceans and melting ice.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"Suppose, magically, that we somehow were to electrify all power, all transportation (including aviation), and all residential, office, and industrial heat via renewable energy (i.e. the idea of ""Electrify Everything!"") tomorrow. What percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our current total would still remain?

Electrify Everything won't solve all the climate issues. That is, it won't shrink our GHG emissions down to 0.

For instance, consider cement. From what I have read, cement production is responsible for about 8% of global emissions. Part of the emissions in producing cement comes from industrial heat, namely, about 40% of cement's emissions. THAT part would go away if we were to electrify the heat with renewables somehow. But the remaining 60% of emissions from producing cement comes from the chemical process itself, in which CO2 is released as a chemical byproduct when limestone is turned into calcium oxide. So, just from cement alone, that is nearly 5% of global GHG emissions that would remain even if we electrify everything.

Or take agriculture. Cattle burps/farts release methane. I've seen estimates that this methane constitutes 4% of global GHGs. Then there is nitrous oxide produced by soil microbes acting on synthetic fertilizer spread on crops (about half of which goes unused by the crops). I've seen estimates that this nitrous oxide from fertilizers is around 3% of global GHGs. Electrifying everything won't reduce methane from cattle or nitrous oxide from excess fertilizer.

So, already with just cement, cows, and fertilizer, that is 12% of global emissions that would be wholly untouched even by a vastly successful Electrify Everything strategy. And that 12%  does not include the effects of deforestation, permafrost methane, plastics production, the industrial production of other chemicals, etc.

**Has anyone tried to put a number on what percentage of GHG emissions would still remain even if we electrify all power, transportation, and heat with renewables?**

20%? 25%? 30%?

In short, how much of our climate problem would Electrify Everything solve?

(Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of using renewable energy to electrify as much as we can. I'm just curious how much warming will be left even if we are wildly successful with electrification.)

**EDIT:** Reddit user cybercuzco below posts a link to a World in Data chart that (as best I can tell) seems to be what I am after: https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector. If that is right, this suggests the answer to my question is that a massively successful Electrify Everything transition would (holding all else constant) eliminate around 73% of our GHG emissions and thus leave 27% of emissions unabated.",t2_ed95mxbb,"Suppose we ""Electrify Everything!""

>For the second consecutive year, ice cover on the Great Lakes remains significantly below average for this time of year, which typically sees the peak of ice cover at levels around 53 percent. As of February 11, total ice coverage across all lakes measured a mere 2.7 percent. Lakes Erie and Ontario are basically at‚Äîor tied with‚Äîtheir respective historic lows for this time of year, making both essentially ice-free. This record low ice cover is largely attributed to [unusually warm temperatures](https://www.climate.gov/media/15821 ""https://www.climate.gov/media/15821"")  throughout the region in December, paired with the generally short duration of Arctic air blasts.

Typically, maximum ice cover usually peaks in late February or early March, with the Great Lakes consistently reaching a basin-wide maximum in annual ice coverage of about 53 percent since reliable satellite data collection began in 1973. However, over the last 50 years, the amount of ice has dropped about 5 percent each decade, amounting to a 25 percent decrease.

>Ice plays an important role in the ecosystems, economy, and coastal resilience of the Great Lakes. It is a natural part of the yearly cycle of the Great Lakes, upon which many animal species, ranging from microbial to larger fauna, rely on for protecting their young and harboring eggs. The lakes also see most of their significant storms and large wave events during the colder months of late fall through winter.

[A paper published last December](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0f72) reported how insects responded to wildflowers planted on two solar farms in rural Minnesota.

From 2018 to 2022, researchers from Argonne National Lab visited the solar farms around 20 times to monitor the health of the plants and study the insects they attracted.

By the end of the study, the scientists had spotted almost 11,000 different insects, and they discovered that the number of native bees at the solar farms surged, growing 20-fold in just five years.

They even found monarch butterflies and their caterpillar progenitors in the fields. With pollinators facing a dramatic decline, habitats like this are essential.

Three out of every four plants in North America, including crops, depend on pollinators.

Luckily, the bounty of bugs these habitats attract spills over into surrounding fields.

In fact, more bees visit farms near the flower-skirted solar panels than visit those further afield.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"There are loads of talks about how solar and wind energy alone aren't enough if we really want to move towards clean energy. Yet there's more and more chatter about building more solar and wind farms and investing in these renewable sources - while we all know we need a mix of different renewables to really make a difference. It's the same old story for everyone - the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow... yea yea... you can see it especially in the UK where wind energy drops off dramatically during the summer.

I've been following CorPower Ocean's journey (https://corpowerocean.com/a-short-history-of-wave-energy/) for a while now, and I'm really chuffed about their recent big investment. While I'm glad there's more discussion about ocean energy, I really feel there's a lack of talks about tidal energy. Tidal energy is predictable and reliable, and I know some people say it's not always there, but as long as the moon and gravity exist, tides are pretty much always around - not like waves, solar, wind, etc., which depend on the weather.

There are already some great tidal energy technologies that can produce clean and, most importantly, reliable energy - like Orbital Marine Power, Nova, and my favourite one because of their seashell design and technology that's completely 3D printed and, as I understand it, much cheaper than other technologies - Spiralis Energy (https://www.spiralis.energy). Yet, they all lack investment, and more importantly, tidal energy itself isn't getting the buzz it deserves, even though it could be a really big deal.

Due to tax reasons it would be best to move to another EU country, but I‚Äòm open to also go somewhere else in the world.

On the other hand, some northern countries will get a milder climate‚Ä¶

### Tasks, measures and timelines for ‚ÄòBeautiful China‚Äô

**BEAUTIFUL CHINA:** The top bodies of the Chinese  government and governing Communist party ‚Äì¬†the state council and the  central committee, respectively¬†‚Äì¬†issued the full text of new  instructions on ‚Äúcomprehensively promoting the construction of a  Beautiful China‚Äù in a 27 December official release, published by state  news agency [Xinhua](http://www.news.cn/politics/20240111/b1e10e998f644683b7e64d8bf8ff589b/c.html)  on 11 January. The Beautiful China initiative is a ‚Äútop-level  development blueprint detailing specific targets for‚Ä¶the nation‚Äôs green  and high-quality growth‚Äù, another [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240111/7c1eac3e23d14552a110a1a47c063244/c.html) report explained. [ClientEarth](https://www.clientearth.org/)‚Äôs Dimitri De Boer wrote in [China Dialogue](https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/10235-opinion-what-does-xi-s-thought-mean-for-the-environment/) that the initiative ‚Äúties a good environment to a sense of national pride‚Äù.

**KEY GOALS:** The document outlined a slew of tasks,  measures and timelines within China‚Äôs overall push to peak its carbon  emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. By 2027,  ‚Äúgreen and low-carbon development‚Äù will be ‚Äúfurther promoted‚Äù, it said.  By 2035, ‚Äúgreen production methods and lifestyles will be widely  formed‚Äù. By the middle of the century, ‚Äúecological civilisation will be  comprehensively upgraded‚Ä¶\[with\] deep decarbonisation achieved in key  areas‚Äù. Goals listed in the document include: the country will compile  an annual national greenhouse gas inventory; ‚Äúgradually shift‚Äù to ‚Äú[dual control‚Äù of carbon emissions](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-china/#dual-control); protect more than 3.15m square kilometres of land from being eligible for development projects under the national ecological ‚Äú[red line](https://chinadialogue.net/en/digest/china-publishes-first-blue-book-on-ecological-redlines/)‚Äù  policy; ensure China‚Äôs cities become ‚Äúwaste-free‚Äù by 2035; and see new  energy vehicles (NEVs, mostly electric vehicles) comprise around 45% of  new cars by 2027.¬†¬†

**OFFICIAL COMMENT:** The document was passed in a  meeting chaired by Chinese president Xi Jinping, who said that ‚Äúbuilding  a Beautiful China is an important goal for building a modern socialist  country‚Äù, the state-run [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202311/09/WS654c2c48a31090682a5ed36b.html)  reported ‚Äì giving the document more weight and signalling to officials  that China‚Äôs carbon-neutrality goals remain an important target. Adding  to the momentum, following its publication, Sun Jinlong and Huang Runqiu  ‚Äì the Communist party secretary and the minister at the ministry of  ecology and environment (MEE), respectively ‚Äì wrote an opinion piece in  the Communist party-backed newspaper [People‚Äôs Daily](http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2024/0116/c1001-40159652.html)  saying that the document ‚Äúclearly defines the overall requirements, key  tasks and major initiatives‚Äù guiding the Beautiful China initiative. In  an interview with [Xinhua](https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/202401/content_6925525.htm),  a senior official of the MEE said incentives and policy measures could  ‚Äúmobilise enthusiasm, initiative and creativity‚Äù to build a Beautiful  China.",t2_jw8ix,"China has a new climate & environment strategy ""Beautiful China"".

>NASA announced that 2023 was the [hottest year on record](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/ ""https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/""), according to an analysis of annual global average temperatures by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Scientists who maintain the temperature record, which begins in 1880, calculate a [global temperature anomaly](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q101 ""https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q101"") each year to determine how much temperatures have changed compared to temperatures from 1951‚Äì1980.     
          
>But what caused 2023, especially the second half of it, to be so hot? ...  
            
>The long-term rise in greenhouse gases is the primary driver.  
         
>>For more than 100 years, humans have been burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil to power everything from lightbulbs and cars to factories and cities. These actions, along with changes in land use, have led to a rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. [Greenhouse gases](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/"") act like a blanket trapping heat around the planet. The more of them you add, the thicker that blanket becomes, further heating Earth.  
        
>>In May 2023, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere peaked at [424 parts per million](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/"") at NOAA‚Äôs Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The annual peak has been steadily rising since measurements began in 1958. (Other global carbon measurement projects showed similarly high numbers.) Extending the record back even further with ice cores, carbon dioxide concentrations are the highest they have been in at least [800,000 years](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/"").    
            
>The return of El Ni√±o added to the heat.  
           
>>On top of the long-term global warming trend are natural variations in the climate. One of the largest sources of such year-to-year variability is the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which occurs in the tropical Pacific.  
        
>>From 2020‚Äì2022, the Pacific saw three years of [La Ni√±a conditions](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three""). Then [El Ni√±o returned](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151481/el-nino-returns ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151481/el-nino-returns"") beginning in May 2023. This El Ni√±o has not yet been as strong as those in 2015‚Äì2016 or 1997‚Äì1998, both of which caused large global average temperature spikes. However, when you add this ocean warming to the long-term warming trend from greenhouse gases, the start of El Ni√±o helped temperatures jump enough to create a new record for heat.  
       
>>‚ÄúFor the most part, it‚Äôs us and El Ni√±o,‚Äù said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, humans are heating the planet, and El Ni√±o is dancing on our heads.‚Äù
            
>Globally, long-term ocean warming and hotter-than-normal sea surface temperatures played a part.  
          
>>Looking more broadly, the tropical Pacific wasn‚Äôt the only part of the ocean that was hotter than normal this year. The global sea surface temperature [set new records in 2023](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever""), with the North Atlantic and other parts of the ocean experiencing several marine heat waves.  
        
>>‚ÄúJust like global temperatures, ocean temperatures are on the rise,‚Äù said Willis. ‚ÄúThey have been rising for the last century or more, and they are not slowing down. If anything, they are speeding up.‚Äù  
     
>>What‚Äôs behind the rise in ocean temperatures? Greenhouse gases warming the planet. [Around 90 percent](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/"") of the heat trapped by rising greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean. That means that as greenhouse gases continue to increase, so will ocean temperatures, which raises temperatures across the globe.  
          
>Aerosols are decreasing, so they are no longer slowing the rise in temperatures.  
             
>>Another global trend that scientists are monitoring is a change in aerosols in the atmosphere. [Aerosols](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols"") are small particles in the air‚Äîsuch as smoke, dust, volcanic gases, sea spray, air pollution or soot‚Äîthat can [impact the climate](https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3271/aerosols-small-particles-with-big-climate-effects/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3271/aerosols-small-particles-with-big-climate-effects/""). Airborne particles can either reflect sunlight, causing a slight cooling of the air, or absorb sunlight, causing a slight warming of it.  
         
>>As governments have passed regulations to reduce air pollution and improve air quality, the abundance of aerosols has been decreasing in most areas. Many of these human-produced particles are the type that cool the climate slightly, so with less of them in the air, the result is a slight warming effect. But this contribution is quite small in comparison to the much greater warming from rising greenhouse gases.   
         
>Scientists found that the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‚Äòapai volcanic eruption did not substantially add to the record heat.  
         
>>In January 2022, the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‚Äòapai undersea volcano blasted an unprecedented amount of water vapor and fine particles, or aerosols, into the stratosphere. Water vapor, a greenhouse gas, can produce a warming effect on the atmosphere, so scientists investigated the impact of the eruption on the global temperature. [Sulfate aerosols from eruptions](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/volcanoes-can-affect-climate#:~:text=Injected%20ash%20falls%20rapidly%20from,potential%20to%20promote%20global%20warming ""https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/volcanoes-can-affect-climate#:~:text=Injected%20ash%20falls%20rapidly%20from,potential%20to%20promote%20global%20warming""), on the other hand, have sometimes led to some global cooling events.  
        
>>A [recent study](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104634 ""https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104634"") found that the volcanic sulfate aerosols reflected some sunlight away from Earth‚Äôs surface, leading to a slight cooling of less than 0.1 degrees in the southern hemisphere following the eruption. Essentially, the warming that occurred from the increase in water vapor in the stratosphere was offset by the cooling caused by volcanic sulfate aerosols leading to a slight cooling lower in the atmosphere.

ClimateChange,climatechange,"So there's this thing called a ""blue ocean event"" that suggests once Arctic sea ice hits less than 1 million SQ km, irreversible tipping points will occur that will worsen the climate and heat the world by several degrees (allegedly, its controversial but let's assume it's real).

So now we've all read the report of AMOC potentially collapsing this century and causing temperatures in northern hemisphere to plummet.

Could this hypothetically lower temperatures around the North Pole, thus increasing sea ice and prevent a blue ocean event?

""As our planet grapples with the consequences of man-made climate change and the excessive summer heat it is causing, a lesser-known repercussion is coming to light: its correlation with the uptick in gun-related incidents in America‚Äôs cities. But how exactly are rising temperatures and gun violence intertwined, and could addressing the effects of climate change in cities hold the key to curbing this alarming trend?

  
According to a [recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799635?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=121622) by researchers at the University of Washington and Boston University looking at heat and shootings in 100 U.S. cities from 2015 to 2020, nearly 7% of gun violence incidents could be directly attributed to above-average seasonal temperatures. In New York City, that percentage doubles to around 15%.

That means that in New York in 2020, a pandemic year with the highest number of shooting incidents in the city‚Äôs recent history, an estimated 286 shooting incidents wouldn‚Äôt have occurred if it wasn‚Äôt exceptionally hot outside, according to the researchers. That‚Äôs one of the highest of the 100 cities studied, said [Jonathan Jay](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/jonathan-jay/), a Boston University researcher and a co-author of the paper.

‚ÄúIn general, the Northeast and the Midwest had shown the most dramatic heat effects,‚Äù Jay said.

Aiming to better understand how day-to-day fluctuations in temperatures affect the number of gun violence incidents, the researchers analyzed U.S. shooting data from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) from 2015 to 2020. To more accurately demonstrate the impact of daily temperature changes, they made sure to factor in specific tendencies that take place in different seasons like holidays, more kids being out of school ‚Äì what scientists call ‚Äúseasonality‚Äù ‚Äì¬† in their analyses.""",t2_9xjmg,The Heat is Killing Us: Climate change & rising temps are increasing gun violence,0.92,58,1729698370.0,1729698370.0,11,Damaso21,1gadrho
